       "'Vice Presidential Debate at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Utah October 07, 2020 PARTICIPANTS:\\nSenator Kamala Harris (D-CA) and\\nVice President Mike Pence (R) MODERATOR:\\nSusan Page (USA Today) PAGE:\\xa0Good evening. From the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, welcome to the first, and only, vice presidential debate of 2020, sponsored by the nonpartisan Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m Susan Page of USA TODAY. It is my honor to moderate this debate, an important part of our democracy. In Kingsbury Hall tonight we have a small and socially distant audience and we’ve taken extra precautions during this pandemic. Among other things, everyone in the audience is required to wear a face mask and the candidates will be seated 12 feet apart. The audience is enthusiastic about their candidates, but they’ve agreed to express that enthusiasm, only twice. At the end of the debate and now when I introduce the candidates. Please welcome California Senator Kamala Harris and Vice President Mike Pence. PENCE:\\xa0Thank you. PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris and Vice President Pence thank you for being here. We’re meeting as President Trump and the First Lady continue to undergo treatment in Washington after testing positive for COVID-19. We send our thoughts and prayers to them for their rapid and complete recovery and for the recovery of everyone afflicted by the coronavirus. The two campaigns and the Commission on Presidential Debates have agreed to the ground rules for tonight. I’m here to enforce them on behalf of the millions of Americans who are watching. One note, no one in either campaign, or at the commission or anywhere else has been told in advance what topics I’ll raise or what questions I’ll ask. This ninety-minute debate will be divided into nine segments of about 10 minutes each. I’ll begin a segment by posing a question to each of you, sometimes the same question, sometimes a different question on the same topic. You will then have two minutes to answer, without interruption by me or the other candidate. Then we’ll take six minutes or so to discuss the issue. At that point, although there will always be more to say, we’ll move on to the next topic. We want a debate that is lively, but Americans also deserve a discussion that is civil. These are tumultuous times, but we can and will have a respectful exchange about the big issues facing our nation. Let’s begin with the ongoing pandemic that has cost our country so much. Senator Harris, the coronavirus is not under control. Over the past week, Johns Hopkins reports that 39 states have had more COVID cases over the past seven days than in the week before. Nine states have set new records. Even if a vaccine is released soon, the next administration will face hard choices. What would a Biden administration do in January and February that a Trump administration wouldn’t do? Would you impose new lockdowns for businesses and schools in hotspots? A federal mandate to wear masks? You have two minutes to respond, without interruption. HARRIS:\\xa0Thank you Susan. Well, the American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country. And here are the facts. 210,000 dead people in our country in just the last several months. Over 7 million people who have contracted this disease. One in five businesses closed. We’re looking at frontline workers who have been treated like sacrificial workers. We are looking at over 30 million people who in the last several months had to file for unemployment. And here’s the thing, on January 28, the vice president and the president were informed about the nature of this pandemic. They were informed that it’s lethal in consequence, that it is airborne, that it will affect young people and that it would be contracted because it is airborne. And they knew what was happening, and they didn’t tell you. Can you imagine if you knew on January 28, as opposed to March 13, what they knew what you might have done to prepare? They knew and they covered it up. The president said it was a hoax. They minimized the seriousness of it. The president said you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, you’re on the other side of his ledger if you don’t. And in spite of all of that, today they still don’t have a plan. They still don’t have a plan. Well, Joe Biden does. And our plan is about what we need to do around a national strategy for contact tracing, for testing, for administration of the vaccine and making sure that it will be free for all. That is the plan that Joe Biden has and that I have, knowing that we have to get a hold of what has been going on and we need to save our country. And Joe Biden is the best leader to do that and frankly, this administration has forfeited their right to reelection, based on this. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you- Thank you, Senator Harris. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, more than 210,000 Americans have died of COVID-19 since February. The US death toll as a percentage of our population is higher than that of almost every other wealthy nation on Earth. For instance, our death rate is two and a half times that of Canada, next door. You head the administration’s Coronavirus Task Force. Why is the U.S. death toll, as a percentage of our population, higher than that of almost every other wealthy country? And you have two minutes to respond, without interruption. PENCE:\\xa0Susan thank you. And I want to thank the Commission and the University of Utah for hosting this event. And Senator Harris, it’s a privilege to be on the stage with you. Our nation has gone through a very challenging time this year. But I want the American people to know that from the very first day, President Donald Trump has put the health of America first. Before there were more than five cases in the United States, all people who had returned from China, President Donald Trump did what no other American president had ever done. And that was he suspended all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Senator, Joe Biden opposed that decision. He said it was xenophobic and hysterical, but I can tell you, having led the White House Coronavirus Task Force, that that decision alone by President Trump bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. And I believe it’s saved hundreds of thousands of American lives. Because with that time we were able to reinvent testing. More than 115 million tests have been done to date. We were able to see to the delivery of billions of supplies so our doctors and nurses had the resources and support they needed. And we began, really before the month of February it was hard to develop a vaccine and to develop medicines and therapeutics that’ve been saving lives all along the way. And under President Trump’s leadership, Operation Warp Speed, we believe, will have literally tens of millions of doses of a vaccine before the end of this year. The reality is, when you look at the Biden plan, it reads an awful lot like what President Trump and I and our task force have been doing every step of the way. And quite frankly, when I look at their plan that talks about advancing testing, creating new PPE, developing a vaccine, umm, it looks a little bit like plagiarism, which is something Joe Biden knows a little bit about. I think the American people know that this is a president who has put the health of America first and the American people, I believe with my heart, can be proud of the sacrifices they have made. It’s saved countless American lives. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice Pres- Thank you Vice President Pence- Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, would you like to respond? HARRIS:\\xa0Oh, absolutely. Whatever the Vice President’s claiming the administration has done, clearly it hasn’t worked when you’re looking at over 210,000 dead bodies in our country, American lives that have been lost, families that are grieving that loss. And you know, the vice president is the head of the task force and knew, on January 28, how serious this was. And then, big thanks to Bob Woodward, we learned that they knew about it. And then when that was exposed, the vice president said when asked ‘Well, why didn’t y’all tell anybody?’, he said ‘Because the president wanted people to remain calm’. PAGE:\\xa0Well, let’s go – HARRIS:\\xa0No, I – Susan, I – This is important – PENCE:\\xa0Susan, I have to weigh in here – HARRIS:\\xa0Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking. PENCE:\\xa0I have to weigh in – HARRIS:\\xa0I’m speaking. I wanna – PAGE:\\xa0You have 15 more seconds and then we’ll give the vice president a chance to respond. HARRIS:\\xa0Thank you. So I want to ask the American people, how calm were you when you were panicked about where you’re going to get your next roll of toilet paper? How calm were you when your kids were sent home from school and you didn’t know when they could go back? PAGE:\\xa0Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris – HARRIS:\\xa0How calm were you when your children couldn’t see your parents because you were afraid they could kill them? PAGE:\\xa0Let’s give Vice President Pence a chance to respond. Vice President Pence, you have one minute to respond. PENCE:\\xa0You know there’s not a day gone by that I haven’t thought of every American family that’s lost a loved one. And I want all of you to know that you’ll always be in our hearts and in our prayers. But when you say what the American people have done over these last eight months hasn’t worked, that’s a great disservice to the sacrifices the American people have made. HARRIS:\\xa0I’m referring to your president. PENCE:\\xa0The reality – If I may, if I may finish, Senator. The reality is Dr. Fauci said everything that he told the President in the Oval Office, the President told the American people. Now President Trump I will tell you has boundless confidence in the American people and he always spoke with confidence that we’d get through this together. But when you say it hasn’t worked – when Dr. Fauci and Dr. Birks and our medical experts came to us in the second week of March, they said if the President didn’t take the unprecedented step of shutting down roughly half of the American economy that we could lose 2.2 million Americans. That’s the reality. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0They also said to us if we did everything right, Susan, we could still lose more than 200,000 Americans. PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0Now, one life lost is too many, Susan. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – PENCE:\\xa0But the American people, I believe, deserve credit for the sacrifices that they have made, putting the health of their family and their neighbors first, our doctors, our nurses, our first responders – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– and I’m going to speak up on behalf of what the American people have done. PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence, you were in the front row at a Rose Garden event 11 days ago, at what seems to have been a super-spreader event for senior administration and congressional officials. No social distancing, few masks, and now a cluster of coronavirus cases among those who were there. How can you expect Americans to follow the administration safety guidelines to protect themselves from COVID when you at the White House have not been doing so? PENCE:\\xa0Well, the American people have demonstrated over the last eight months that when given the facts they’re willing to put the health of their families, and their neighbors and people they don’t even know first. President Trump and I have great confidence in the American people and their ability to take that information and put it into practice. In the height of the epidemic, when we were losing a heartbreaking number of 2,500 Americans a day, we surged resources to New Jersey, and New York, and New Orleans and Detroit. We told the American people what needed to be done and the American people made the sacrifices. When the outbreak in the Sunbelt happened this summer, again, Americans stepped forward. But the reality is the work of the President of the United States goes on. A vacancy on the Supreme Court of the United States has come upon us and the president introduced Judge Amy Coney Barrett – PAGE:\\xa0Yes, thank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0At that- If I may say, that Rose Garden event, there’s been a great deal of speculation about it. My wife Karen and I were there and honored to be there. Many of the people who were at that event, Susan, actually were tested for coronavirus. And it was an outdoor event, which all of our scientists regularly and routinely advise, the difference here is President Trump and I trust the American people to make choices in the best interest of their health. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris consistently talk about mandates, and not not just mandates with the coronavirus but a government takeover of healthcare, the Green New Deal – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you- Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– all government control. We’re about freedom and respecting the freedom of the American people. HARRIS:\\xa0Let’s talk about respecting the American people. You respect the American people when you tell them the truth. You respect the American people when you have the courage to be a leader – PENCE:\\xa0Which we’ve always done – HARRIS:\\xa0– speaking of those things that you may not want people to hear but they need to hear so they can protect themselves. But this administration stood on information that if you had as a parent, if you had as a worker knowing you didn’t have enough money saved up, and now you’re standing in a food line because of the ineptitude of an administration that was unwilling to speak the truth to the American people. So let’s talk about caring about the American people. The American people who have had to sacrifice far too much because of the incompetence of this administration. It is asking too much of the people – PENCE:\\xa0Susan, we talked about the American people – PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence – HARRIS:\\xa0– It is asking too much of the people that they would not be equipped with the information they need to help themselves to protect their parents and their children. PENCE:\\xa0Susan, the president – PAGE:\\xa0No, I’m sorry. Kamala Harris – Senator Harris, I mean. I’m sorry. HARRIS:\\xa0It’s fine. I’m Kamala. PAGE:\\xa0No, no, you’re Senator Harris to me. For life to get back to normal Dr. Anthony Fauci and other experts say that most of the people who can be vaccinated need to be vaccinated, but half of Americans now say they wouldn’t take a vaccine if it was released now. If the Trump administration approves a vaccine, before or after the election, should Americans take it and would you take it? HARRIS:\\xa0If the public health professionals, if Dr. Fauci, if the doctors tell us that we should take it, I’ll be the first in line to take it. Absolutely. But if Donald Trump tells us that we should take it, I’m not taking it. PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence, there have been a lot of repercussions from this pandemic. In recent days, the president’s diagnosis of COVID-19 has underscored the importance of the job that you hold, and that you are seeking. That’s our second topic tonight, it’s the role of the vice president. One of you will make history on January 20, you will be the vice president to the oldest president the United States has ever had. Donald Trump will be 74-years-old on Inauguration Day. Joe Biden will be 78-years-old. That already has raised concerns among some voters, concerns that have been sharpened by President Trump’s hospitalization in recent days. Vice President Pence, have you had a conversation or reached an agreement with President Trump about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, do you think you should? You have two minutes without interruption. PENCE:\\xa0Well, Susan, thank you. Although I would like to go back – PAGE:\\xa0I think we need to move on to the issue of the vice presidency – PENCE:\\xa0Well, thank you but, I would like to go back. Because the reality is that we’re going to have a vaccine, Senator, in record time, in unheard of time, in less than a year. We have five companies in phase three clinical trials. And we’re right now producing tens of millions of doses. So, the fact that you continue to undermine public confidence in a vaccine if the vaccine emerges during the Trump administration, I think is unconscionable. And Senator, I just ask you, stop playing politics with people’s lives. The reality is that we will have a vaccine, we believe, before the end of this year, and it will have the capacity to save countless American lives. And your continuous undermining of confidence in a vaccine is just, it’s just unacceptable. And let me also say, you know the reality is when you talk about, about failure in this administration, we actually do know what failure looks like in a pandemic. It was 2009. The Swine Flu arrived in the United States. Thankfully, it was, ended up not being as lethal as the coronavirus. But before the end of the year, when Joe Biden was Vice President of the United States, not seven and a half million people contracted the swine flu, 60 million Americans contracted the swine flu. If the swine flu had been as lethal as the coronavirus in 2009 when Joe Biden was vice president, we would have lost 2 million American lives. His own Chief of Staff Ron Klain would say last year that it was pure luck. That they did “everything possible wrong”. And we learned from that. They left the Strategic National Stockpile empty. They left an empty and hollow plan, but we still learned from it. And I think – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up – PENCE:\\xa0– the American people, I’m gonna say again, can be proud of what we have done– PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence, I’m sorry. Your time is up– Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– and, Senator, please stop undermining confidence in a vaccine. PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked Vice President Pence, which is have you had a conversation, or reached an agreement with Vice President Biden, about safeguards or procedures when it comes to the issue of presidential disability? And if not, and if you win the election next month, do you think you should? You have two minutes, uninterrupted. HARRIS:\\xa0So let me tell you first of all, on the day I got the call from Joe Biden, it was actually a Zoom call, asking me to serve with him on this ticket was probably one of the most memorable, memorable days of my life. I, you know, I thought about my mother, who came to the United States at the age of 19, gave birth to me at the age of 25 at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California. And the thought that I’d be sitting here right now I know would make her proud and she must be looking down on this. You know Joe and I were raised in a very similar way. We were raised with values that are about hard work, about the value and the dignity of public service and about the importance of fighting for the dignity of all people. And I think Joe asked me to serve with him because I have a career that included being elected the first woman District Attorney of San Francisco, where I created models of innovation for law enforcement, in terms of reform of the criminal justice system. I was elected the first woman of color, and black woman, to be elected Attorney General of the state of California, where I ran the second largest Department of Justice in the United States, second only to the United States Department of Justice. There I took on everything from transnational criminal organizations, to the big banks that were taking advantage of homeowners, to for profit colleges that were taking advantage of veterans. And then, of course, now I serve in the United States Senate as only the second black woman ever elected to the United States Senate. I serve on the Senate Intelligence Committee where I’ve been in regular receipt of classified information about threats to our nation and hotspots around the world. I’ve traveled the world. I’ve met with our soldiers in our, in war zones. And I think Joe has asked me to serve with him because he knows that we share, we share a purpose, which is about lifting up the American people. And after the four years that we have seen of Donald Trump, unifying our country around our common values and principles. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Harris. You know neither, neither President Trump nor Vice President Biden has released the sort of detailed health information that had become the modern norm until the 2016 election. And in recent days, President Trump’s doctors have given misleading answers or refused to answer basic questions about his health. And my question to each of you, in turn, is, is this information voters deserve to know? Vice President Pence, would you like to go first? PENCE:\\xa0Well, Susan, thank you. And let me, let me say on behalf of the President and the First Lady, how moved we’ve all been by the outpouring of prayers and concern for the President. And I do believe it’s emblematic of the prayers and the concern that have ushered forth for every American impacted by the coronavirus. But the care the president received at Walter Reed Hospital, White House doctors, was exceptional. And the transparency that they practiced all along the way will continue because the American people have a right to know about the health and well-being of their President. And we’ll continue to do that. But I’m just extremely grateful and was more than, more than a little moved by the broad and bipartisan support. And, Senator, I want to thank you and Joe Biden for your expressions and genuine concern. And I also want to congratulate you, as I did on that phone call, on the historic nature of your nomination. HARRIS:\\xa0Thank you. PENCE:\\xa0I never expected to be on this stage four years ago so I know the feeling. But the reality is, we’ve got an election before the American people, in the midst of this challenging year, and the stakes have never been higher. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence. I wanna give Senator Harris a chance to respond to the same question I asked, which is do voters have a right to know more detailed health information about presidential candidates, and especially about presidents, especially when they’re facing some kind of challenge? HARRIS:\\xa0Absolutely. And that’s why Joe Biden has been so incredibly transparent. And certainly, by contrast, the President has not, both in terms of health records, but also let’s look at taxes. We now know because of great investigative journalism that Donald Trump paid $750 in taxes. When I first heard about it, I literally said “You mean $750,000?”. And it was like no, $750. We now know Donald Trump owes and is in debt for $400 million. And just so everyone is clear, when we say in debt it means you owe money to somebody. And it’d be really good to know who the President of the United States, the Commander in Chief, owes money to because the American people have a right to know what is influencing the president’s decisions. And is he making those decisions on the best interest of the American people, of you, or self interest. So, Susan, I’m glad you asked about transparency, because it has to be across the board. Joe has been incredibly transparent over many, many years. The one thing we all know about Joe, he puts it all out there. He, he is honest. He is forthright. But Donald Trump on the other hand, has been about covering up everything. PENCE:\\xa0Susan – PENCE:\\xa0Thank – Thanks – Thank you, Senator Harris. I want to give you a chance to respond, Vice President. PENCE:\\xa0Well, look, I respect the fact that Joe Biden spent 47 years in public life. I respect your public service as well. HARRIS:\\xa0Thank you. PENCE:\\xa0But the American people have a president who is a businessman, he’s a job-creator. He’s paid tens of millions of dollars in taxes, payroll taxes, property taxes. He’s created tens of thousands of American jobs. The president said those public reports are not accurate. And the President also released, literally, stacks of financial disclosures the American people can review just as the law allows. But the distinction here is that Joe Biden, 47 years in public service, compared to President Donald Trump, who brought all of that experience four years ago– PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – Thank you, Vice President – PENCE:\\xa0– and turned this economy around by cutting taxes, rolling back regulation, unleashing American energy- PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– fighting for free and fair trade, and all of that is on the line – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are in the White House. PAGE:\\xa0You know, that’s a good segue into our third topic– HARRIS:\\xa0That’s a great segue. PAGE:\\xa0– which is about the economy. This has been another aspect of life for Americans that’s been so affected by this coronavirus. We have a jobs crisis brewing. On Friday, we learned that the unemployment rate had declined to 7.9% in September, but the job growth had stalled, and that was before the latest round of layoffs and furloughs in the airline industry, at Disney and elsewhere. Hundreds of thousands of discouraged workers have stopped looking for work. Nearly 11 million jobs that existed at the beginning of the year, haven’t been replaced. Those hardest hit include Latinos, blacks and women. Senator Harris, the Biden-Harris campaign has proposed new programs to boost the economy and you would pay for that new spending by raising $4 trillion in taxes on wealthy individuals and corporations. Some economists warn that could curb entrepreneurial ventures that fuel growth and create jobs. Would raising taxes put the recovery at risk? And you have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted. HARRIS:\\xa0Thank you. On the issue of the economy, I think there couldn’t be a more fundamental difference between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Joe Biden believes you measure the health and the strength of America’s economy based on the health, and the strength of the American worker and the American family. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump, who measures the strength of the economy based on how rich people are doing. Which is why he passed a tax bill benefitting the top 1% and the biggest corporations of America, leading to a $2 trillion deficit that the American people are gonna have to pay for. On day one, Joe Biden will repeal that tax bill. He’ll get rid of it. And what he’ll do with the money is invest it in the American people. And through a plan that is about investing in infrastructure, something that Donald Trump said he would do. I remember hearing about some infrastructure week, I don’t think it ever happened. But Joe Biden will do that. He’ll invest in infrastructure. It’s about upgrading our roads and bridges, but also investing in clean energy and renewable energy. Joe is gonna invest that money in what we need to do around innovation. There was a time when our country believed in science and invested in research and development so that we were an innovation leader on the globe. Joe Biden will use that money to invest in education. So for example, for folks who want to go to a two year Community College, it will be free. If you come from a family that makes less than $125,000, you’ll go to a public university for free. And across the board, we’ll make sure that if you have student loan debt it’s cut by $10,000. That’s how Joe Biden thinks about the economy, which is it’s about investing in the people of our country, as opposed to passing a tax bill, which had the benefit of letting American corporations go offshore to do their business. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Harris. HARRIS:\\xa0You’re welcome. PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence, your administration has been predicting a rapid and robust recovery, but the latest economic report suggests that’s not happening. Should Americans be braced for an economic comeback that is going to take not months, but a year or more? You have two minutes to answer, uninterrupted. PENCE:\\xa0When President Trump and I took office, America had gone through the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression. When Joe Biden was vice president they tried to tax, and spend, and regulate, and bail our way back to a growing economy. President Trump cut taxes, across the board. Despite what Senator Harris says, the average American family of four had $2,000 in savings in taxes. And with the rise in wages that occurred, most predominantly for blue-collar, hardworking Americans, the average household income for a family of four increased by $4,000 following President Trump’s tax cuts. But America, you just heard Senator Harris tell you, on day one Joe Biden’s gonna raise your taxes. It’s really remarkable to think, Susan – HARRIS:\\xa0That’s not what I said. PENCE:\\xa0– I mean, right after a time where we’re going through a pandemic that lost 22 million jobs at the height, we’ve already added back 11.6 million jobs because we had a president who cut taxes, rolled back regulation, unleashed American energy, fought for free and fair trade, and secured $4 trillion from the Congress of the United States to give direct payments to families, saved 50 million jobs through the paycheck protection program. We literally have spared no expense to help the American people and the American worker through this. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to raise taxes. They want to bury our economy under a $2 trillion Green New Deal, which you were one of the original co-sponsors of in the United States Senate. They want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking, which would cost hundreds of thousands of American jobs all across the Heartland. And Joe Biden wants to go back to the economic surrender to China that when we took office, half of our international trade deficit was with China alone. And Joe Biden wants to repeal all of the tariffs that President Trump put into effect to fight for American jobs and American workers. Joe Biden says democracy’s on the ballot. Make no mistake about it, Susan. The American economy, the American comeback is on the ballot with four more years of growth and opportunity – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– with four more years of President Donald Trump. 2021 is gonna be the biggest economic year in the history of this country. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris? HARRIS:\\xa0Well, I mean, I thought we saw enough of it in last week’s debate, but I think this is supposed to be a debate based on fact and truth. And the truth and the fact is, Joe Biden has been very clear. He will not raise taxes on anybody who makes less than $400,000 a year – PENCE:\\xa0He said he’s going to repeal the Trump tax cuts – HARRIS:\\xa0Mr. Vice President I’m speaking. PENCE:\\xa0Well – HARRIS:\\xa0I’m speaking. PENCE:\\xa0– it’d be important if you said the truth. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that he’s going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. That was tax cuts that gave the average working family $2,000 in a tax break every single year – HARRIS:\\xa0That is – That is absolutely not true – PENCE:\\xa0– Senator, that’s the math – HARRIS:\\xa0– that tax bill – PENCE:\\xa0Is he only gonna repeal part of the Trump tax cuts? HARRIS:\\xa0If you don’t mind letting me finish – PENCE:\\xa0Please HARRIS:\\xa0We can then have a conversation. Okay? PENCE:\\xa0Please HARRIS:\\xa0Okay. Joe Biden will not raise taxes on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that. Joe Biden is the one who during the Great Recession was responsible for the Recovery Act that brought America back. And now the Trump Pence Administration wants to take credit when they ran when they rode the coattails of Joe Biden’s success for the economy that they had at the beginning of their term. Of course now the economy is a complete disaster, but Joe Biden on the one hand, did that. On the other hand you have Donald Trump, who has reigned over a recession that is being compared to the Great Depression. On the one hand you have Joe Biden, who was responsible with President Barack Obama for the Affordable Care Act, which brought health care to over 20 million Americans and protected people with pre-existing conditions and what it also did is it saved those families, who otherwise were going bankrupt because of hospital bills they could not afford. On the other hand, you have Donald Trump who is in court right now trying to get rid of – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Harris – HARRIS:\\xa0– trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which means that you will lose protections, if you have pre-existing conditions. And I just, this is very important, Susan – PAGE:\\xa0Yes, well we need to give – We need to give Vice President – HARRIS:\\xa0– and it’s just – He interrupted me and I’d like to just finish, please. If you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they’re coming for you. If you love someone who has a pre-existing condition – PENCE:\\xa0Nonsense PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – Thank you, Senator Harris – PENCE:\\xa0That’s nonsense HARRIS:\\xa0– they’re coming for you. If you are under the age of 26 on your parents coverage, they’re coming for you. PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris, thank you. HARRIS:\\xa0You’re welcome. PAGE:\\xa0Let me give you a chance to respond. PENCE:\\xa0Well I hope we have a chance to talk about health care because Obamacare was a disaster and the American people remember it well. President Trump and I have a plan to improve health care and to protect, protect pre-existing conditions for every American. But look, Senator Harris, you’re entitled to your own opinion but you’re not entitled to your own facts – HARRIS:\\xa0That’s a good line. PENCE:\\xa0You yourself said on multiple occasions when you were running for president that you would ban fracking. Joe Biden looked his supporter in the eye and pointed and said “I guarantee, I guarantee that we will abolish fossil fuels.” We have a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, Susan, that your newspaper USA TODAY said really wasn’t that very different from the original Green New Deal. More taxes, more regulation, banning fracking, abolishing fossil fuel, crushing American energy and economic surrender to China is a prescription for economic decline. President Trump and I will keep America growing. The V-shape recovery that’s underway right now will continue with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you very, very much, Vice President Pence. Once again you provided the perfect segue to a new topic, which is climate change. And Vice President Pence, I’d like to pose the first question to you. This year we’ve seen record-setting hurricanes in the south. Another one, Hurricane Delta is now threatening the gulf. And we have seen record-setting wildfires in the West. Do you believe, as the scientific community has concluded, that man-made climate change has made wildfires bigger, hotter and more deadly? And it made hurricanes wetter, slower and more damaging? You have two minutes, uninterrupted. PENCE:\\xa0Thank you Susan. Well first, I’m very proud of our record on the environment and on conservation. According to all of the best estimates, our, our air and land are cleaner than any time ever recorded. And our water is among the cleanest in the world. And just a little while ago, the president signed the Outdoors Act, the largest investment in our public lands and public parks in 100 years. So, President Trump has made a commitment to conservation and to the environment. Now with regard to climate change, the climate is changing. But the issue is, what’s the cause and what do we do about it. President Trump has made it clear that we’re going to continue to listen to the science. Now Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, would put us back in the Paris Climate Accord. They’d impose the Green New Deal, which would crush American energy, would increase the energy cost of American families in their homes and literally would crush American jobs. President Trump and I believe that the progress that we have made in a cleaner environment has been happening precisely because we have a strong free market economy. You know what’s remarkable is the United States has reduced CO2 more than the countries that are still in the Paris Climate Accord, but we’ve done it through innovation. And we’ve done it through natural gas and fracking, which, Senator, the American people can go look at the record. I know Joe Biden says otherwise now, as you do, but the both of you repeatedly committed to abolishing fossil fuel and banning fracking. HARRIS:\\xa0That’s not true. PENCE:\\xa0And so by creating the kind of American innovation, we’re actually steering toward a stronger and better environment. With regard to wildfires, President Trump and I believe that forest management has to be front and center, and even Governor Gavin Newsome from your state has agreed we’ve got to work on forest management. And with regard to hurricanes, the National Oceanic Administration tells us that actually as, as difficult as they are – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – Thank you, Vice President – PENCE:\\xa0– there are no more hurricanes today than there were 100 years ago – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – Thank you – PENCE:\\xa0– but many of the climate alarmists use hurricanes and wildfires to try and – PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence, I’m sorry, your time is up – Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– sell the bill of goods of a Green New Deal. And President Trump and I are gonna always put American jobs and American workers first. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence. Senator Harris, as the Vice President mentioned, you co-sponsored the Green New Deal in Congress, but Vice President Biden said in last week’s debate that he does not support the Green New Deal. But if you look at the Biden Harris campaign website it describes the Green New Deal as a crucial framework. What exactly would be the stance of a Biden Harris Administration toward the Green New Deal? You have two minutes, uninterrupted. HARRIS:\\xa0Alright, so first of all, I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact. I will repeat that Joe Biden has been very clear that he thinks about growing jobs, which is why he will not increase taxes for anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year. Joe Biden’s economic plan – Moody’s, which is a reputable Wall Street firm – has said will create 7 million more jobs than Donald Trump’s. And part of those jobs, that will be created by Joe Biden, are going to be about clean energy and renewable energy. Because you see, Joe understands that the West Coast of our country is burning, including my home state of California. Joe sees what is happening on the Gulf states, which are being battered by storms. Joe has seen and talked with the farmers in Iowa, whose entire crops have been destroyed because of floods. And so Joe believes, again, in science. I’ll tell you something, Susan, I served, when I first got to the Senate, on the committee that’s responsible for the environment. Do you know this administration took the word science off the website? And then took the phrase climate change off the website? This– We have seen a pattern with this administration which is they don’t believe in science. And Joe’s plan is about saying we’re going to deal with it, but we’re also going to create jobs. Donald Trump, when asked about the wildfires in California and the question was, you know, the science is telling us this, you know what Donald Trump said? Science doesn’t know. So, let’s talk about who is prepared to lead our country over the course of the next four years on what is an existential threat to us as human beings. Joe is about saying we’re going to invest that in renewable energy, we’re going to be about the creation of millions of jobs, we will achieve net zero emissions by 2050, carbon neutral by 2035– Joe has a plan. This has been a lot of talk from the Trump administration, and really it has been to go backward instead of forward. We will also reenter the climate agreement with pride. PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris just said that climate change is an existential threat. Vice President Pence, do you believe that climate change poses an existential threat? PENCE:\\xa0As I said, Susan, the climate is changing. We’ll follow the science, but, once again, Senator Harris is denying the fact that they’re gonna raise taxes on every American. Joe Biden said twice in the debate last week that on day one he was going to repeal the Trump tax cuts. Those tax cuts delivered $2,000 in tax relief to the average family of four across America. And with regard to banning fracking, I just recommend that people look at the record. You yourself said repeatedly that you would ban fracking. You were the first senate co-sponsor of the Green New Deal. And while Joe Biden denied the Green New Deal, Susan, thank you for pointing out, the Green New Deal is on their campaign website. And as USA TODAY said, it’s essentially the same plan as you co-sponsored with AOC when she submitted it in the Senate. And you just heard the senator say that she’s going to resubmit America to the Paris Climate Accord. Look, the American people have always cherished our environment. We will continue to cherish it. We’ve made great progress reducing CO2 emissions through American innovation and the development of natural gas through fracking. We don’t need a massive, $2 trillion Green New Deal that would impose all new mandates on American businesses and American families, Joe Biden wants us to retrofit 4 million– PAGE:\\xa0Thank you – Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– American business buildings. It makes no sense. It will cost jobs. President Trump – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– he’s gonna put America first. He’s going to put jobs first and we’re gonna take care of our environment and follow the science. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – HARRIS:\\xa0On the issue of jobs – PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris HARRIS:\\xa0Let’s talk about that. You, the Vice President earlier referred to, as part of what he thinks is an accomplishment, the President’s trade war with China. You lost that trade war. You lost it. What ended up happening is, because of a so-called trade war with China, America lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs. Farmers have experienced bankruptcy, because of it. We are in a manufacturing recession, because of it. And when we look at where this administration has been, there are estimates that by the end of the term of this administration, they will have lost more jobs than almost any other presidential administration – PENCE:\\xa0Susan – HARRIS:\\xa0– And the American people know what I’m talking about. You know. I think about 20-year-olds, you know we have a 20-year-old, 20-something-year-old, who are coming out of high school and college right now and you’re wondering, “Is there going to be a job there for me?”. We’re looking at people who are trying to figure out how they’re going to pay rent by the end of the month. Almost half of American renters are worried about whether they’re going to be able to pay rent by the end of the month. This is where the economy is in America right now and it is because of the catastrophe and the failure of leadership of this administration. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you just 15 seconds to respond because then I want to move on. PENCE:\\xa0Well, I’d love to respond. Look, lost the trade war with China? Joe Biden never fought it. Joe Biden has been a cheerleader for Communist China through over the last several decades. And, and again, Senator Harris, you’re entitled to your opinion, you’re not entitled to your own facts. When Joe Biden was vice president, we lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs and President Obama said they were never coming back. He said we needed a magic wand to bring them back. In our first three years, after we cut taxes, rolled back regulation – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– unleashed American energy, this administration saw 500,000 manufacturing jobs created – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– And that’s exactly the kind of growth we’re going to continue to see as we bring our nation through this pandemic – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0– your Green New Deal, your massive new mandates, your Paris Climate Accord, it’s gonna kill jobs this time just like it killed jobs in the last administration. HARRIS:\\xa0Susan, I just need to respond very briefly, please. PAGE:\\xa015 seconds and then we’ll move on. HARRIS:\\xa0Thank you. Thank you. Joe Biden is responsible for saving America’s auto industry and you voted against it. So let’s set the record straight. Thank you. PAGE:\\xa0I’d like to talk about China. We have, as our next topic, we have no more complicated or consequential foreign relationship than the one with China. It is a huge market for American agricultural goods. It’s a potential partner in dealing with climate change and North Korea. And in a video tonight, President Trump again blamed it for the coronavirus, saying “China will pay.” Vice President Pence, how would you describe our, our fundamental relationship with China? Competitors? Adversaries? Enemies? You have two minutes. PENCE:\\xa0Thank you Susan. Well let me, before I leave that, let me, let me speak to voting records, if I can. You know, everybody knows that NAFTA caused literally thousands of American factories to close. We saw automotive jobs go south of the border. President Trump fought to renegotiate NAFTA, and the United States, Mexico, Canada agreement is now the law of the land. American people deserve to know Senator Kamala Harris was one of only 10 members of the Senate to vote against the USMCA. It was a huge win for American auto workers. It was a huge win for American farmers, especially dairy in the upper Midwest. But, Senator, you said it didn’t go far enough on climate change, that you put your, your radical environmental agenda ahead of American auto workers and ahead of American jobs. I think the American people deserve to know that. It’s probably why Newsweek magazine said that, that Kamala Harris was the most liberal member of the United States Senate in 2019, more liberal than Bernie Sanders, more, more liberal than any of the others in the United States Senate. So, now with regard to China, Susan, first and foremost — China is to blame for the coronavirus. And President Trump is not happy about it. He’s made that very clear. He made it clear again today. China and the World Health Organization did not play straight with the American people. They did not let our personnel into China to get information on the coronavirus until the middle of February. Fortunately, President Trump, in dealing with China from the outset of this administration — standing up to China, that had been taking advantage of America for decades — in the wake of Joe Biden’s cheerleading for China, President Trump made that decision before the end of January to suspend all travel from China. And again, the American people deserve to know, Joe Biden opposed President Trump’s decision to suspend all travel from China. He said it was hysterical, he said it was xenophobic – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – Vice President Pence, your time is up – PENCE:\\xa0– but President Trump has stood up to China and will continue to stand strong. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0We want to improve the relationship, but we’re going to level the playing field and we’re going to hold China accountable for what they did to America with the coronavirus. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you. Senator Harris, let me ask you the same question that I asked the Vice President. How would you describe our fundamental relationship with China? Are we competitors, adversaries, enemies? You’ll have two minutes, uninterrupted. HARRIS:\\xa0Susan, the Trump administration’s perspective, and approach to China has resulted in the loss of American lives, American jobs and America’s standing. There is a weird obsession that President Trump has had with getting rid of whatever accomplishment was achieved by President Obama and Vice President Biden. For example, they created, within the White House, an office that basically was responsible for monitoring pandemics. They got away, they got rid of it. PENCE:\\xa0Not true. HARRIS:\\xa0There was a team of disease experts that President Obama and Vice President Biden dispatched to China to monitor what is now predictable and what might happen. They pulled them out. We now are looking at 210,000 Americans who have lost their lives. Let’s look at the job situation we mentioned before, the trade deal – the trade war, they wanted to call it – with China. It resulted in the loss of over 300 manufacturing jobs, and a manufacturing recession, and the American consumer paying thousands of dollars more for goods, because of that failed war, that they called it. And let’s talk about standing. Pew, a reputable research firm, has done an analysis that shows that leaders of all of our formerly allied countries have now decided that they hold in greater esteem and respect Xi Jinping, the head of the Chinese Communist Party, than they do Donald Trump, the President of the United States, the commander in chief of the United States. This is where we are today, because of a failure of leadership by this administration. PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris, we’ve seen changes in the role of the United States, in terms of global leadership, over the past four years – and of course times do change. What’s your definition – we’ve seen strains with China, of course, as the Vice President mentioned, we’ve seen strains with our traditional allies in NATO and elsewhere. What is your definition of the role of American leadership in 2020? HARRIS:\\xa0So, you know Joe is – I love talking with Joe about a lot of these issues, and you know, Joe, I think, he said it, quite well. He says, you know, ‘Foreign policy: it might sound complicated, but really it’s relationships, they’re – just think about it as relationships. And so we know this, in our personal, professional relationships – you gotta keep your word to your friends. Got to be loyal to your friends. People who have stood with you, got to stand with them. You got to know who your adversaries are, and keep them in check. But what we have seen with Donald Trump is that he has betrayed our friends and embraced dictators around the world. Let’s take for example, Russia. So, Russia – I serve on the Intelligence Committee of the United States Senate. America’s intelligence community told us Russia interfered in the election of the President of the United States in 2016 and is playing in 2020. Christopher Wray, the director of the FBI, said the same, but Donald Trump, the commander in chief of the United States of America prefers to take the word of Vladimir Putin over the word of the American intelligence community. You look at our friends at NATO. He has walked away from agreements – you can look at the Iran nuclear deal, which now has put us in a position where we are less safe, because they are building up what might end up being a significant nuclear arsenal. We were in that deal, guys, we were in the Iran nuclear deal with friends, with allies around the country, and because of Donald Trump’s unilateral approach to foreign policy, coupled with his isolationism, he pulled us out and has made America less safe. So Susan, it’s about relationships. And the thing that has always been part of the strength of our nation, in addition to our great military, has been that we keep our word. But Donald Trump doesn’t understand that, because he doesn’t understand what it means to be honest. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me give you a chance to respond. PENCE:\\xa0Well, thank you. Well, President Trump kept his word when we moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem, the capital of the State of Israel. When Joe Biden was vice president, they promised to do that and never did. We’ve stood strong with our allies, but we’ve been demanding. NATO is now contributing more to our common defense than ever before. Thanks to President Trump’s leadership, we’ve strengthen our alliances across the Asia Pacific. And we’ve stood strong against those who would do us harm. You know when President Trump came into office, ISIS had captured an area of the Middle East, the size of Pennsylvania. President Trump unleashed the American military, and our armed forces destroyed the ISIS caliphate and took down their leader al Baghdadi without one American casualty. al Baghdadi was responsible for the death of thousands. But notably, America’s hearts today are with the family of Kayla Mueller, the parents of which are here with us tonight in Salt Lake City. Today, two of the ISIS killers responsible for Kayla Mueller’s murder, were brought to justice in the United States. Jihadi John was killed on the battlefield, along with the other few. The reality is that when Joe Biden was vice president, we had an opportunity to save Kayla Mueller. Breaks my heart to reflect on it, but the military came into the Oval Office, presented a plan. They said they knew where Kayla was. Baghdadi had held her for 18 months, abused her mercilessly before they killed her. But when Joe Biden was vice president, they hesitated for a month. And when Armed Forces finally went in, it was clear she’d been moved two days earlier, and her family says — with a heart that broke the heart of every American — that if President Donald Trump had been president, they believe Kayla would be alive today. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President. PENCE:\\xa0We destroyed the ISIS caliphate. And you talk about reentering the Iran nuclear deal. I mean, the last administration transferred $1.8 billion to the leading state sponsor of terrorism – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President. PENCE:\\xa0President Donald Trump got us out of the deal, and when Qasim Soleimani was traveling to Baghdad, to do harm to Americans, President Donald Trump took him out. And America is safer, our allies are safer and the American people should know – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President. I would like to give Senator Harris a chance to respond, but not at such great length because of course there are other topics we want to talk about. HARRIS:\\xa0But I would like equal time. PENCE:\\xa0Yes. Please go ahead. HARRIS:\\xa0First of all, to the Mueller family, I know about your daughter’s case, and I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry. What happened to her is awful. And it should have never happened. And I know Joe feels the same way. And I know that President Obama feels the same way. But you mentioned Soleimani. Let’s start there. So, after the strike on Soleimani, there was a counter strike on our troops in Iraq. And they suffered serious brain injuries, and do you know what Donald Trump dismissed them as? Headaches. And this is about a pattern of Donald Trump’s, where he has referred to our men who are serving in our military, as suckers and losers. Donald Trump, who went to Arlington Cemetery, and stood above the graves of our fallen heroes and said, ‘What’s in it for them?’ Because, of course, you know he only thinks about what’s in it for him. Let’s take what he said about John McCain. A great American hero. And Donald Trump says he doesn’t deserve to be called a hero because he was a prisoner of war. Take – and this is, this is very important. When you want to talk about who is the current commander in chief, and what they care about and what they don’t care about. Public reporting that Russia had bounties on the heads of American soldiers, and you know what a bounty is? Somebody puts a price on your head, and they will pay it if you are killed. And Donald Trump had talked at least six times to Vladmir Putin, and never brought up the subject. Joe Biden would never do that. Joe Biden – Joe Biden would hold Russia to account for any threat to our nation’s security or to our troops who are sacrificing their lives for the sake of our democracy and our safety. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Harris. This is such an important issue, but we have other important issues as well and I want to make sure we have a chance. PENCE:\\xa0I really have to respond to that. She has – PAGE:\\xa0Fifteen seconds, because – PENCE:\\xa0Well, I’ve got to have more than that. PAGE:\\xa0I’m sorry, Mr. Vice President, you’ve had more time than she’s had, so far – PENCE:\\xa0The slanders against President Donald Trump regarding men and women of our armed forces are absurd. PAGE:\\xa0I’m sorry, Vice President Pence – PENCE:\\xa0My son is a captain in the United States Marine Corps, my son in law is deployed in the United States Navy. I can assure all of you with sons and daughters serving in our military, President Donald Trump not only respects but reveres all of those who served in our armed forces, and any suggestion otherwise is ridiculous. Let me also say – PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence. Vice President Pence. I didn’t – Vice President Pence – I did not create the rules for tonight. Your campaigns agreed to the rules for tonight’s debate, with the Commission on Presidential Debates. I’m here to enforce them, which involves moving from one topic to another, giving roughly equal time to both of you, which is what I’m trying very hard to do. So I want to go ahead and move to the next topic, which is an important one, as the last topic was, and that is the Supreme Court. On Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to open hearings on Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court. Senator Harris, you’ll be there as a member of the committee. Her confirmation would cement the court’s conservative majority, and make it likely open to more abortion restrictions, even to overturning the landmark Roe v Wade ruling. Access to abortion would then be up to the states. Vice President Pence, you’re the former governor of Indiana. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want Indiana to do? Would you want your home state to ban all abortions? You have two minutes, uninterrupted. PENCE:\\xa0Well thank you for the question, but I’ll use a little bit of my time to respond to that very important issue before. The American people deserve to know, Quasem Soleimani, the Iranian general, was responsible for the death of hundreds of American servicemembers. When the opportunity came, we saw him headed to Baghdad to kill more Americans, President Trump didn’t hesitate and Quasem Soleimani is gone. But you deserve to know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris actually criticized the decision to take out Quasem Soleimani. It’s really inexplicable, but with regard to Joe Biden it’s explainable, because history records that Joe Biden actually opposed the raid against Osama bin Laden. It’s absolutely essential that we have a commander in chief who will not hesitate to act to protect American lives and to protect American servicemembers, and that’s what you have in President Donald Trump. Now with regard to the Supreme Court of the United States. Let me say, President Trump and I could not be more enthusiastic about the opportunity to see Judge Amy Coney Barrett become Justice Amy Coney Barrett. She’s a brilliant woman, and she will bring a lifetime of experience and a sizable American family, to the Supreme Court of the United States. And our hope is, in the hearing next week, unlike Justice Kavanaugh received with treatment from you and others. We hope she gets a fair hearing. And we particularly hope that we don’t see the kind of attacks on her Christian faith that we saw before. Democratic Chairman of the Judiciary Committee before, when Judge Barrett was being confirmed for the Court of Appeals, expressed concern that the “dogma of her faith lived loudly in her.” Dick Durbin of Illinois said that it was a concern. Senator, I know one of our judicial nominees, you actually attacked because they were a member of the Catholic Knights of Columbus, just because the Knights of Columbus holds pro-life views. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you. Thank you, Vice President Pence, your time is up. PENCE:\\xa0My hope is that when the hearing takes place, that Judge Amy Coney Barrett will be respected – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you Vice President. PENCE:\\xa0– treated respectfully and voted and confirmed to the Supreme Court of United States. PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris, you’re the senator from and former Attorney General of California. So let me ask you a parallel question to the one I posed to the vice president. If Roe v Wade is overturned, what would you want California to do? Would you want your home state to enact no restrictions on access to abortion? And you have two minutes, uninterrupted. PENCE:\\xa0Thank you, Susan. First of all, Joe Biden and I are both people of faith. And it’s insulting to suggest that we would knock anyone for their faith, and in fact, Joe if elected will be only the second practicing Catholic, as President of the United States. On the issue of this nomination – Joe and I are very clear, as are the majority of the American people. We are 27 days before the decision about who will be the next president of the United States. And you know before, when this conversation has come up, you know it’s been about election year or election time. We’re literally in an election. Over 4 million people have voted. People are in the process of voting right now. And so Joe has been very clear, as the American people are: Let the American people fill that seat in the White House, and then we’ll fill that seat on the United States Supreme Court. And to your point, Susan, the issues before us couldn’t be more serious. There’s the issue of choice, and I will always fight for a woman’s right to make a decision about her own body. It should be her decision and not that of Donald Trump, and the Vice President, Michael Pence. But let’s also look at what else is before the court. It’s the Affordable Care Act. Like, literally in the midst of a public health pandemic – when over 210,000 people have died and 7 million people probably have what will be in the future considered a pre-existing condition because you contracted the virus – Donald Trump is in court right now trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’ve said it before and it bears repeating: This means that there will be no more protections, if they win, for people with pre-existing conditions. This means that over 20 million people will lose your coverage. It means that if you’re under the age of 26, you can’t stay on your parents coverage anymore. And here’s the thing. The contrast couldn’t be more clear. They’re trying to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. Joe Biden is saying let’s expand coverage, let’s give you a choice of a public option or private coverage, let’s bring down premiums, let’s lower Medicare eligibility to 60. That’s true leadership. PAGE:\\xa0You know, you mentioned earlier, Vice President Pence, that the President was committed to maintaining protections for people with pre-existing conditions and — but you do have this court case that you are supporting, your administration is supporting, that would strike down the Affordable Care Act. The president says, President Trump says, that he’s going to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but he has not explained how he will do that. And that was one of the toughest nuts to crack, when they were passing the Affordable Care Act. So, tell us, specifically – how would your administration protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, have access to affordable insurance if the Affordable Care Act is struck down. PENCE:\\xa0Well, thank you, Susan. Let me just say, addressing your very first question, I couldn’t be more proud to serve as vice president to a President who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. I’m pro-life. I don’t apologize for it. And this is another one of those cases where there’s such a dramatic contrast. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion, all the way up to the moment of birth, late-term abortion. They want to increase funding to Planned Parenthood of America. Now for our part, I would never presume how Judge Amy Coney Barrett would rule on the Supreme Court of the United States but we’ll continue to stand strong for the right to life. When you speak about the Supreme Court, though, I think the American people really deserve an answer, Senator Harris. Are you and Joe Biden gonna pack the court if Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed? I mean, there have been 29 vacancies on the Supreme Court during presidential election years, from George Washington to Barack Obama. Presidents have nominated in all 29 cases. But your party is actually openly advocating adding seats to the Supreme Court, which has had nine seats for 150 years, if you don’t get your way. This is a classic case of if you can’t win by the rules, you’re going to change the rules. Now you’ve refused to answer the question, Joe Biden has refused to answer the question. I think the American people would really like to know. If Judge Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States, are you and Joe Biden, if somehow you win this election, going to pack the Supreme Court to get your way? HARRIS:\\xa0I’m so glad we went through a little history lesson. Let’s do that a little more. In 1864 – PENCE:\\xa0Well, I’d like you to answer the question. HARRIS:\\xa0Mr. Vice President, I’m speaking. I’m speaking. In 1864, one of the, I think, political heroes – certainly of the president, and I assume of you also, Mr. Vice President – is Abraham Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was up for reelection, and it was 27 days before the election, and a seat became open on the United States Supreme Court. Abraham Lincoln’s party was in charge, not only in the White House, but the Senate. But honest Abe said it’s not the right thing to do. The American people deserve to make the decision about who will be the next President of the United States, and then that person can select who will serve for a lifetime on the highest court of our land. And so Joe and I are very clear: the American people are voting right now. And it should be their decision about who will serve on this most important body for a lifetime. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Harris and – PENCE:\\xa0Well, Susan. People are voting right now. They’d like to know if you and Joe Biden are gonna pack the Supreme Court if you don’t get your way in this nomination. HARRIS:\\xa0Let’s talk about packing – PENCE:\\xa0Once again, you gave a non-answer, Joe Biden gave a non-answer. HARRIS:\\xa0I’m trying to answer you now.\\xa0 PENCE:\\xa0The people deserve a straight answer. And if you haven’t figured it out yet, the straight answer is they are going to pack the Supreme Court if they somehow win this election. I gotta tell you, people across this country, if you cherish our Supreme Court, if you cherish the separation of powers, you need to reject the Biden-Harris ticket come November the third and reelect President Donald Trump. We will stand by that separation powers and a nine seat Supreme Court. HARRIS:\\xa0Let’s talk about packing the court then. Let’s talk about. PENCE:\\xa0Please – HARRIS:\\xa0Yeah, I’m about to. So, the Trump-Pence administration has been – because I sit on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Susan, as you mentioned. And I’ve witnessed the appointments, for lifetime appointments to the federal courts, district courts, Courts of Appeal — people who are purely ideological people who have been reviewed by legal professional organizations and found to have been not competent, are substandard. And do you know that of the 50 people who President Trump appointed to the Court of Appeals for lifetime appointments, not one is Black? This is what they’ve been doing. You want to talk about packing a court? Let’s have that discussion. PAGE:\\xa0All right, thank you. Thank you, Senator. Let’s go on and talk about the issue of racial justice. PENCE:\\xa0I just want the record to reflect, she never answered the question. Maybe the next debate Joe Biden will answer the question. But I think the American people know the answer. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President. In March, Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency room technician in Louisville, was shot and killed after police officers executing a search warrant on a narcotics investigation broke into her apartment. The police said they identified themselves. Taylor’s boyfriend said he didn’t hear them do that. He used a gun registered to him to fire a shot, which wounded an officer. The officers then fired more than 20 rounds into the apartment. They say they were acting in self-defense. None of them have been indicted in connection with her death. Senator Harris, in the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes. HARRIS:\\xa0I don’t believe so, and I’ve talked with Breonna’s mother, Tamika Palmer, and her family, and her family deserves justice. She was a beautiful young woman. She had as her life goal to become a nurse, and she wanted to become an EMT to first learn what’s going on out on the street, so she could then become a nurse and save lives. And her life was taken, unjustifiably and tragically and violently. And it just, it brings me to, you know, the eight minutes and 46 seconds that America witnessed, during which an American man was tortured and killed under the knee of an armed, uniformed police officer. And people around our country, of every race, of every age, of every gender – perfect strangers to each other – marched shoulder to shoulder, arm and arm, fighting for us to finally achieve that ideal of equal justice under law. And I was a part of those peaceful protests. And I believe strongly that, first of all, we are never going to condone violence, but we always must fight for the values that we hold dear, including the fight to achieve our ideals. And that’s why Joe Biden and I have said on this subject, look, and I’m a former career prosecutor. I know what I’m talking about. Bad cops are bad for good cops. We need reform of our policing in America and our criminal justice system, which is why Joe and I will immediately ban chokeholds and carotid holds. George Floyd would be alive today if we did that. We will require a national registry for police officers who break the law, we will – on the issue of criminal justice reform – get rid of private prisons and cash bail and we will decriminalize marijuana, and we will expunge the records of those who have been convicted of marijuana. This is a time for leadership. On a tragic, tragic issue… PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator. Thank you, Senator Harris. Vice President Pence, let me pose the same question to you. In the case of Breonna Taylor, was justice done? You have two minutes, uninterrupted. PENCE:\\xa0Well our heart breaks for the loss of any innocent American life, and the family of Breonna Taylor has our sympathies. But I trust our justice system, a grand jury that reviews the evidence. And it really is remarkable, that as a former prosecutor, you would assume that in a panel grand jury, looking at all the evidence, got it wrong. But you’re entitled to your opinion, Senator. And with regard to George Floyd, there’s no excuse for what happened to George Floyd. Justice will be served. But there’s also no excuse for the rioting and looting that followed. I mean, it really is astonishing. Flora Westbrook is with us here tonight in Salt Lake City. Just a few weeks ago, I stood at what used to be her salon, was burned to the ground. By rioters and looters. And Flora is still trying to put her life back together. And I must tell ya, this, this presumption that you hear consistently from Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, that America is systemically racist. That as Joe Biden said, that he believes that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities, is a great insult to the men and women who serve in law enforcement. And I want everyone to know, who puts on the uniform of law enforcement every day, that President Trump and I stand with you. It is remarkable that when Senator Tim Scott tried to pass a police reform bill, brought together a group of Republicans and Democrats – Senator Harris, you got up and walked out of the room. And then you filibustered Senator Tim Scott’s bill on the Senate floor that would have provided new accountability, new resources. But we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement, improving public safety, and supporting our African American neighbors and all of our minorities. Under President Trump’s leadership – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Mr. Vice President PENCE:\\xa0– we will always stand with law enforcement and we’ll do what we’ve done from day one which is improve the lives of African Americans. Record unemployment, record investments in education –\\xa0 PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Mr. Vice President. PENCE:\\xa0– Fight for school choice, for – PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris. HARRIS:\\xa0I will not sit here and be lectured by the Vice President on what it means to enforce the laws of our country. I am the only one on this stage who has personally prosecuted everything from child sexual assault to homicide. I’m the only one on this stage who has prosecuted the big banks for taking advantage of America’s homeowners. I am the only one on this stage who prosecuted for-profit colleges for taking advantage of our veterans. And the reality of this is, that we are talking about an election in 27 days where last week, the President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists. And – PENCE:\\xa0Not true. HARRIS:\\xa0– it wasn’t like he didn’t have a chance. He didn’t do it, and then he doubled down. And then he said, when pressed, ‘Stand back. Stand by.’ And this is a part of a pattern of Donald Trump’s. He was – he called Mexicans rapists and criminals. He instituted as his first act a Muslim ban. He, on the issue of Charlottesville, where people were peacefully protesting the need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches shouting racial epithets, anti semitic slurs. And Donald Trump, when asked about it, said there were fine people on both sides. This is who we have as the President of the United States. And America, you deserve better. Joe Biden will be a president who brings our country together. PAGE:\\xa0Senator Harris – HARRIS:\\xa0– and recognizes the beauty in our diversity and the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us. PAGE:\\xa0Vice President Pence, let me give you a minute to respond. PENCE:\\xa0Thank you, Susan. I appreciate that very much. I think that’s one of the things that makes people dislike the media so much in this country, Susan. That you selectively edit, just like Senator Harris did, comments that President Trump and I, and others on our side of the aisle make. Senator Harris conveniently omitted, after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments, he condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly. Your concern that he doesn’t condemn neo-Nazis – President Trump has Jewish grandchildren. His daughter and son-in-law are Jewish. This is a president who respects and cherishes all of the American people. But you talk about having personally prosecuted – I’m glad you brought up your record, Senator. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you. PENCE:\\xa0I really need to make this point. When you were DA in San Francisco, when you left office, African Americans were 19 times more likely to be prosecuted for minor drug offenses than whites and Hispanics. When you were Attorney General of California, you increased the disproportionate incarceration of Blacks in California. You did nothing on criminal justice reform in California. You didn’t lift a finger to pass the first step back on Capitol Hill. The reality is, your record speaks for itself. President Trump and I have fought for criminal justice, for – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President Pence PENCE:\\xa0– fought for educational choice and opportunities for African Americans – PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, sir. PENCE:\\xa0And we’ll do it for four more. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you. You know there is no more important issue than the final issue that we’re going to talk about tonight, and that is the issue of the election itself. HARRIS:\\xa0Susan, he attacked my record. I would like an opportunity to respond. PAGE:\\xa0Let me give you 30 seconds because we’re running out of time. HARRIS:\\xa0I appreciate that. First of all, having served as the Attorney General of the State of California, the work that I did is a model of what our nation needs to do and we will be able to do under a Joe Biden presidency. Our agenda includes what this administration has failed to do. It will be about not only instituting a ban on chokeholds and carotid holes. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you. HARRIS:\\xa0I would like to go through – PAGE:\\xa0These are points that you made earlier in the hour and I want to talk about the election itself before we have to – HARRIS:\\xa0But I want to talk about the connection between what Joe and I will do and my record, which includes – I was the first statewide officer to institute a requirement that my agents would wear body cameras and keep them on full time. We were the first to initiate a requirement that there would be a training for law enforcement on implicit bias, because yes, Joe Biden and I recognize that implicit bias does exist, Mr. Vice President, contrary to what you may believe. We did the work of instituting reforms that were about investing in reentry. This is the work that we have done and the work we will do going forward and, again, I will not be lectured by the Vice President, on our record of what we have done in terms of law enforcement and keeping our community safe and a commitment to reforming the criminal justice system of America. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Harris, and I’d like to pose the – I’d like you to respond first to the question on our final topic, the election itself. President Trump has, several times, refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If your ticket wins and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what steps would you and Vice President Biden then take? What would happen next? You have two minutes. HARRIS:\\xa0So, I’ll tell you. Joe and I are particularly proud of the coalition that we’ve built around our campaign. We probably have one of the broadest coalitions of folks that you’ve ever seen in a presidential race. Of course we have the support of Democrats, but also independents and Republicans, in fact, seven members of President George W. Bush’s cabinet are supporting our ticket. We have the support of Colin Powell, Cindy McCain, John Kasich, over 500 generals, retired generals, and former national security experts and advisors are supporting our campaign. And I believe they are doing that because they know that Joe Biden has a deep, deep seated commitment to fight for our democracy, and to fight for the integrity of our democracy, and to bring integrity back to the White House. And so, we believe in the American people. We believe in our democracy. And here’s what I’d like to say to everybody: vote. Please vote, vote early, come up with a plan to vote, go to IWillVote.com. You can also go to Joe Biden.com. We have it within our power in these next 27 days to make the decision about what will be the course of our country for the next four years. And it is within our power, and if we use our vote, and we use our voice, we will win. And we will not let anyone subvert our democracy, with what Donald Trump has been doing as he did on the debate stage last week, when again in front of 70 million people, he openly attempted to suppress the vote. Joe Biden, on the other hand, on that same debate stage – because clearly Donald Trump doesn’t think he can run on a record because it’s a failed record – Joe Biden on that stage, said, ‘Hey, just please vote.’ So I’ll repeat what Joe said. Please vote. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator. Vice President Pence, President Trump has several times refused to commit himself to a peaceful transfer of power after the election. If Vice President Biden is declared the winner and President Trump refuses to accept a peaceful transfer of power, what would be your role and responsibility as Vice President? What would you personally do? You have two minutes. PENCE:\\xa0Well, Susan, first and foremost, I think we’re gonna win this election. Because while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris rattle off a long litany, the establishment in Washington DC and the establishment Joe Biden’s been a part of for 47 years. President Donald Trump has launched a movement of everyday Americans from every walk of life. And I have every confidence that the same Americans that delivered that historic victory in 2016, they see this President’s record, where we rebuild our military, we revived our economy through tax cuts and rolling back regulation, fighting for fair trade, unleashing American energy. We appointed conservatives to our federal courts at every level. And we stood with the men and women of law enforcement every single day, and I think, I think that movement of Americans has only grown stronger in the last four years. When you talk about accepting the outcome of the election, I must tell you, Senator, your party has spent the last three and a half years trying to overturn the results of the last election. It’s amazing. When Joe Biden was vice president of the United States, the FBI actually spied on President Trump and my campaign. I mean there were documents released this week that the CIA actually made a referral to the FBI documenting that those allegations were coming from the Hillary Clinton campaign, and of course, we’ve all seen the avalanche with the — what, what you put the country through, for the better part of three years, until it was found that there was no obstruction, no collusion, case closed. And then Senator Harris, you and your colleagues in the Congress tried to impeach the President of the United States, over a phone call. And now Hillary Clinton has actually said to Joe Biden that under, in her words, under no circumstances should he concede the election. So let me just say, I think we’re gonna win this election. President Trump and I are fighting every day in courthouses to prevent Joe Biden and Kamala Harris from changing the rules and creating this universal mail-in voting, that’ll create a massive opportunity for voter fraud. We have a free and fair election; we know we’re going to have confidence in it. And I believe in all my heart that President Donald Trump’s gonna be reelected for four more years. PAGE:\\xa0You know I’ve, I’ve asked – I’ve written all the questions that I’ve asked tonight, but for the final question of the debate, I’d like to read a question that someone else wrote. The Utah Debate Commission asked students in the state to write essays about what they would like to ask you. And I want to close tonight’s debate with the question posed by Brecklynn Brown. She’s an eighth grader at Springville Junior High in Springville, Utah, and here’s what she wrote. Quote – “When I watch the news, all I see is arguing between Democrats and Republicans. When I watch the news, all I see is citizen fighting against citizen. When I watch the news, all I see are two candidates from opposing parties, trying to tear each other down. If our leaders can’t get along, how are the citizens supposed to get along?” And then she added, “Your examples could make all the difference to bring us together” – end quote. So to each of you, in turn, I’d like you to take one minute, and respond to Brecklynn. Vice President Pence, you have one minute. PENCE:\\xa0Brecklynn, it’s a wonderful question. And let me just commend you for taking an interest in public life. I started following the news when I was very young. And in America, we believe in a free and open exchange of debate. And we celebrate that, and it’s how we’ve created literally the freest and most prosperous nation in the history of the world. I would tell you that – don’t assume that what you’re seeing on your local news networks is synonymous with the American people. You know, I look at the relationship between Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the late justice who we just lost from the Supreme Court, and the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They were on polar opposites, on the Supreme Court of the United States – one very liberal, one very conservative. But what’s been learned since her passing was the two of them and their families were the very closest of friends. Here in America, we can disagree, we can debate vigorously as Senator Harris and I have on this stage tonight. But when the debate is over, we come together as Americans. And that’s what people do in big cities and small towns all across this country, so I just want to encourage you, Brecklynn, I want to tell you that we’re going to work every day to have a government as good as our people, the American people, each and every day. We love a good debate. We love a good argument. But we always come together and are always there for one another in times of need. And we’ve especially learned that through the difficulties of this year. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Vice President. Senator Harris, what would you say to Brecklynn? HARRIS:\\xa0First of all, I love hearing from our young leaders, and when I hear her words, when I hear your words, Brecklynn, I know our future is bright, because it is that perspective on who we are and who we should be – that is a sign of leadership and is something we should all aspire to be. And that you know that brings me to Joe. Joe Biden – one of the reasons that Joe decided to run for president, is after Charlottesville, which we talked about earlier, it so troubled him and upset him, like it did all of us, that there was that kind of hate and division. What propelled Joe to run for president was to see that, over the course of the last four years, what Brecklynn described has been happening. Joe has a long-standing reputation of working across the aisle and working in a bipartisan way. And that’s what he’s going to do as President. Joe Biden has a history of lifting people up and fighting for their dignity. You mean you have to know Joe’s story to know that Joe has known pain, he has known suffering, and he has known love. And so, Brecklynn, when you think about the future, I do believe the future is bright. And it will be because of your leadership, and it will be, because we fight for each person’s voice through their vote. And we get engaged in this election, because you have the ability through your work, and through, eventually, your vote. To determine the future of our country, and what its leadership looks like. PAGE:\\xa0Thank you, Senator Harris, thank you, Vice President Pence. Thank you so much for being with us tonight. We want to thank, also, the University of Utah for its hospitality, and most of all our thanks to all the Americans who watched this debate tonight. Again, our best wishes for a quick recovery to President Trump, the First Lady and everyone who is battling COVID-19. The second presidential debate is next week on October 15, a town hall style debate in Miami. We hope you’ll join us then. Good evening. © COPYRIGHT 2020 THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES.

[<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Candidates, please take your positions behind the podiums while we remind you and our audience of the ground rules.</p>\\n<p>Each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions, 60 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Timing lights will remind you when time is expiring.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> We also remind our audience here in the Sheslow Auditorium at Drake University to be respectful, so the candidates can hear the questions and can hear each other.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Just hours ago, the Republican field narrowed once again. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ended his bid for the presidency.</p>\\n<p>So, with one fewer candidate in the running, let\\'s start with the decision voters here in Iowa are about to face.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, why should voters who are looking for an alternative to the current front-runner, former President Trump, vote for you, rather than former Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, to people of Iowa, good evening. It\\'s great to be in Iowa to have a debate here.</p>\\n<p>Donald Trump\\'s running to pursue his issues. Nikki Haley\\'s running to pursue her donors\\' issues. I\\'m running to pursue your issues and your family\\'s issues and to turn this country around. I\\'m the only one running that\\'s delivered on 100 percent of the promises that I have made.</p>\\n<p>We have delivered huge victories in the state of Florida, things that Republicans have been asking for, for a generation. I\\'m also the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again. We beat the teachers union on universal school choice. We beat Soros on crime. We beat Fauci on COVID. We beat the Dems on election integrity. And I beat the left by banning China from buying land in the state of Florida.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley is running. We don\\'t need another mealymouthed politician who just tells you what she thinks you want to hear just to try to get your vote, then to get in office and to do her donors\\' bidding.</p>\\n<p>She was in another state, and she said the people of Iowa\\'s votes need to be corrected. This is somebody that wrote in her book that Hillary Clinton inspired her to first run for office.</p>\\n<p>I remember Hillary denigrating people on the Republican side as deplorables. We don\\'t need a candidate who\\'s going to look down on Middle America. We have had enough of that. I\\'m the only one that\\'s going to be able to lead this country\\'s revival.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m asking for your support, and I won\\'t let you down.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, a response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think this is a time that we know that we need a new generational leader.</p>\\n<p>We have watched our country be in disarray. We see the world on fire, and we need someone who\\'s had executive experience. I have been a two- term governor that took a double-digit unemployment state and turned it into an economic powerhouse. I was at the U.N. I dealt with Russia, China, Iran every day.</p>\\n<p>But, you\\'re going to find out tonight that there is going to be a lot of Ron\\'s lies that has happened. There are at least a couple of dozen so far that he has done. So, what we\\'re going to do is rather than have him go and tell you all these lies, you can go to DeSantislies.com and look at all of those. There is at least two dozen lies that he has told about me, and you can see where a fact checker say exactly what\\'s going to happen and exactly why it\\'s wrong.</p>\\n<p>So, it will cover the fact that he is only mad about the donors because the donors used to be with him, but they\\'re no longer with him now. And that\\'s because he is upset about the fact that his campaign is exploding. You\\'re going to see the fact that he has switched his policies multiple times, and we\\'ll call that out tonight. But, every time he lies, Drake University, don\\'t turn this into a drinking game, because you will be overserved by the end of the night.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I think this is interesting, because you can actually go to RonDesantis.com, because Nikki Haley has this tactic. If you hold her accountable to her record, first she\\'ll say, I never said that. Well, one good rule of thumb, if she says she has never said something, that definitely means she said it, and then she\\'ll say you\\'re lying, you\\'re lying. That means not only did she say it but she is on videotape saying it. And so, we have all the greatest hits. The reality is Nikki Haley is not somebody that has been willing to stand in and fight on behalf of conservatives.</p>\\n<p>You know, she ran for governor saying she was going to do universal school choice, and she caved to the teachers union. She didn\\'t deliver that. In Florida, I delivered the largest expansion of school choice in the history of the United States. I beat the teachers union, and you know what the results are? When she was governor of South Carolina, she was rated 50th in education, dead last. You know, where Florida is under my watch, number one in the nation.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Your response, Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Go to DeSantislies.com and you can find out for yourself. But, why don\\'t we talk about the fact that if we\\'re going to say this, when Ron was representing Florida, he said that he promised not to raise the debt limit when he got to D.C. Yet, he raised the debt limit by hundreds of billions of dollars. He used to support Ukraine. He supported Ukraine when President Obama was in office. Now, he is trying to copy Trump and saying that he no longer supports Ukraine, and doesn\\'t want to give them foreign aid anymore. He also goes and says that he wants to talk about me insulting Iowans. Iowans know when you\\'re telling a joke.</p>\\n<p>The fact that he is only running in one state is not the way you win President. I\\'m running it all states. But, he should tell Iowans why he authored legislation to ban the renewable fuel standard that\\'s so important to Iowans\\' economy, and the fact that he co-sponsored five different pieces of legislation to get rid of it. And also, then he also said he would never do anything with Social Security. Yet, he voted three times to raise the retirement age of Social Security.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, if you\\'re going to talk about what you said --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- and you did, I think you\\'ve got your own explaining to do --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Well, we\\'re going to --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- rather than telling lies about --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> -- well, thank you, Governor. We\\'re going to get to a lot of these issues in the debate. Governor Haley, when Governor Christie dropped out of the race just a few hours ago, he said the most important issue is \"the character of the candidate\". Governor Christie also said he ran because he knew he would be the only Republican candidate to speak the truth about former President Donald Trump. Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be President again?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think the next President needs to have moral clarity. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that it\\'s taxpayer money, not your own money. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that when you\\'re dealing with dictators in the world, that we always have to fight for democracies and human rights and protecting Americans and preventing war.</p>\\n<p>And so, when you look at Donald Trump, I have said, I think he was the right President at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies, but his way is not my way. I don\\'t have vengeance. I don\\'t have vendettas. I don\\'t take things personally. For me, it\\'s very much about no drama, no whining and getting results and getting them done. So, I don\\'t think that President Trump is the right President to go forward. I think it\\'s time for a new generational leader that\\'s going to go and make America proud again. That\\'s what I\\'m going to try and do.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, what is your response to Chris Christie? Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be President again?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I\\'m running because I\\'m the guy that\\'s going to be able to engineer a comeback for this country. I appreciated what President Trump did. But, let\\'s just be honest. He said he was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to drain the swamp. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to hold Hillary accountable and he let her off the hook. He said he was going to eliminate the debt and he added $7.8 trillion to the debt. So, we need to deliver and get this stuff done.</p>\\n<p>And I think the difference between Nikki Haley and me, and I listened to all that litany of stuff, I debated the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom. I thought he lied a lot. Man, Nikki Haley made -- gives him a run for his money and she may even be more liberal than Gavin Newsom is. We are in a situation here in Florida.</p>\\n<p>And as Republicans, you need somebody that is going to be in there and fight for you. And Nikki Haley, any time the going gets tough, any time people come down, she caves. When you need someone standing and fight for you, don\\'t look for Nikki Haley. You won\\'t be able to find her if you had a search warrant. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Look, I think I dealt with Russia, China, Iran, North Korea every day. No one ever said I caved. I defended America and I fought for America. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>But I\\'ll also say this. This is not a time where you have to have pettiness. I wish Donald Trump was up here on this stage. He\\'s the one that I\\'m running against. He\\'s the one that I wish would be here. He needs to be defending his record. Right now he\\'s not defending the fact that he allowed us to have $8 trillion in debt over four years that our kids are never going to forgive us for. The fact that he didn\\'t deal with China when it came to stealing intellectual property. The fact that they gave us COVID. The fact that they have gone and continued to put up Chinese police stations and continue to threaten our military.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\'t do enough to make sure that we were really standing with our friends and doing some other things. What we need is a leader that\\'s not looking at four years and eight years. We need a president that\\'s looking at 20 and 30 years. Because I want my kids to have a good future. I want them to have one without debt, one where they can read, one with secure borders, one where we have law and order, and one where America is strong.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, with all due respect, you know, for her to single out Donald Trump on China, and, look, I think he could have been tougher on them, 100 percent. When Nikki Haley was governor of South Carolina, she was the number one governor in America for Republicans of bringing China into her state. She wrote a love letter to the ambassador saying that they were a great friend. She is on video saying China is a friend. She had a business, five -- Chinese business five miles from a military base. There is video of her on the website right in front of a Chinese flag saying that she works for them now.</p>\\n<p>So that was her number one achievement as governor was bringing China into the state of South Carolina. So you say you\\'re going to look 10, 20, 30 years down the road? Why wasn\\'t she doing that then when people were raising the red flags about it?</p>\\n<p>In Florida, I banned China from buying land in our state.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Yes, but, Governor DeSantis...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And we kicked them out of our universities. That\\'s what you need to be doing. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re going to talk about China in a little bit. I want to talk about the economy, which according to a recent Des Moines Register poll shows that the economy is the top issue for caucus-goers here.</p>\\n<p>So, Governor Haley, the rate of inflation is down. Prices, though, are still high, and Americans are struggling to afford food, cars, and housing. What is the single most important policy that you would implement as president to make the essentials in Americans\\' lives more important?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think we have to acknowledge that Republicans and Democrats have both done this. I mean, the fact that they\\'ve done all of this wasteful spending, they did a $2.2 trillion COVID stimulus bill that expanded welfare that\\'s now left us with 80 million Americans on Medicaid, 42 million Americans on food stamps. That\\'s a third of our country.</p>\\n<p>What I will do is I think it\\'s time we have an accountant in the White House. We have to have someone that respects taxpayer dollars. And we\\'ll start by clawing back $100 billion of unspent COVID dollars that are still out there.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ll go and instead of 87,000 IRS agents going after middle America, we\\'ll go after the hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID fraud, 1 out of every $7. If 8 percent of our budget is interest, quit borrowing. Cut up the credit cards.</p>\\n<p>I had to balance a budget as governor. You have to balance a budget every day. Why is Congress the only group that refuses to balance a budget? We\\'ll stop the spending. We\\'ll stop the borrowing. We\\'ll eliminate the pet projects and the earmarks. And I\\'ll veto any spending bill that doesn\\'t take us back to pre-COVID levels.</p>\\n<p>And then we want to make sure that we allow the middle class to breathe. We\\'re going to eliminate the federal gas and diesel tax in this country and cut taxes on the middle class and simplify those brackets. And then we want to make the small business tax cuts permanent. They made corporate tax cuts permanent, but they made small business tax cuts temporary. Small businesses are the heartbeat of America. We need to prove it by making those tax cuts permanent. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, what\\'s your response? How would you make those essentials more affordable for Americans?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I disagree with Ambassador Haley. We don\\'t need an accountant in the White House, we need a leader in the White House. And that\\'s what I would bring. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve spoken with Iowans, visiting all 99 counties, and also folks all across this country. The American dream is slipping away. People are working hard. They\\'re getting the most out of their God- given ability. They\\'re doing everything right. And they\\'re falling further and further behind.</p>\\n<p>Trying to afford a new home today, your monthly mortgage payment would probably be twice as much as what it would have been if you were starting out five years ago. We have to make the economy work their those folks.</p>\\n<p>Yes, I\\'m going to battle the spending. In Florida, you look and we have the national debt clock going up to $34 trillion. I see it. If you did a debt clock for the state of Florida, it would be counting down.</p>\\n<p>Because we\\'ve paid down 25 percent of our state debt just since I\\'ve been governor. We\\'re going to open up all energy for production because that will be deflationary.</p>\\n<p>You know, Nikki Haley when she was governor, she promised she would never do the gas tax. Then she tried to raise the gas tax on hardworking South Carolinians. Here\\'s the thing. We need to fly a flag of bold colors carrying the banner of putting the American people first, not the pale pastel of the warmed over corporatism of people like Nikki Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, I want to bring you in, but because Governor DeSantis mentioned the gas tax, you do want to eliminate the federal gas tax. And that tax generated approximately $40 billion in 2022 and helps pay for road construction and repair.</p>\\n<p>So how would you fix America\\'s roads and bridges if you take that money away?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, bless his heart. Desantislies.com. We have never raised a tax.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You try to.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> We\\'ve never raised a tax at all.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You tried. You\\'re on video.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I can tell you right --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So I can tell you that we killed the gas tax multiple times.</p>\\n<p>But what we said is if you want to raise the gas tax, you have to reduce the income tax by five times that amount. They didn\\'t want to do it. We\\'ve killed taxes every step of the way.</p>\\n<p>But if he\\'s going to talk about his economy, I think what we should say is why does Florida have the highest property insurance in the country? Why is it that it is named the American hotspot for inflation? Why is it that his state is now known to have the highest cost of living increases? And why is it that they\\'re saying senior citizens can no longer afford to live in Florida? So that\\'s the first thing I\\'ll say. We don\\'t need him doing that to our country.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to the gas tax, when we eliminate that federal tax, the money is collected in the states and they send it to the feds. The feds attach a lot of strings to it and send it back. 75 percent comes from the state, 25 percent comes from the federal government.</p>\\n<p>What they do when they add those strings is they pay for a lot of things that aren\\'t roads, green spaces, sidewalks, all of those things, but they attach strings. I want that money to stay in the states. I want the states to be able to decide how to spend it. I don\\'t want Washington bureaucrats deciding what we need for scenery and green space and all those other things. I want every state, including the state of Iowa, to make the decisions on how they spend their road spending instead of the federal government.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She kind of admitted that she did try to raise the gas tax, and she\\'s on video saying this. I know she\\'ll say she never said. But she did.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You snippet that.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She did -- she did do it.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You took a little piece of that. That is not true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She also -- she also raise tax --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You are lying again.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She was in South Carolina, that\\'s on the record. And she even proposed a tax on groceries at one point. But I\\'m just thinking, have you seen your grocery bill lately? That\\'s one of the things that\\'s hitting working people the most, that groceries are going up probably twice as much what you do.</p>\\n<p>But I also think it\\'s important that we lift people up. So in Florida, we eliminated all sales tax on every baby item, diapers, wipes, strollers, cribs. We want families to be able to prosper in this country. One of the things that\\'s causing so much problem is the breakdown in the American family. We\\'ve done a lot in Florida to be able to rejuvenate that. But we need to make it easier for people to raise children in this country so that we can have strong families in a strong country.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, at a CNN town hall last week, you said you support a flat tax, which is a single income tax rate for every American. Under your plan, would working families pay the same tax rate as billionaires?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I would only do it if people are better off than they are now. I mean, I want people paying less taxes. Actually, if you think the last year we have numbers for the federal government took in the highest percentage of taxes from the economy since World War II, and yet they\\'re going deep into debt.</p>\\n<p>We have a spending problem in this country. It\\'s not a tax problem in this country. And if you had something that was simple and transparent, not only would that better for economic growth, it\\'s also better to end the weaponization of government.</p>\\n<p>The IRS has been weaponized against conservatives going back to the Obama administration. I was there for that. No one\\'s been held accountable for doing that.</p>\\n<p>You look at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the weaponization of federal power ends the day I become the president of the United States. There\\'s going to be a new sheriff in town. We\\'re going to restore the constitutional accountability that our founding fathers envision when they formatted the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>And you know, I\\'ve talked to folks who have overbearing federal agencies. I mean, you have farmers who have the EPA coming on their farmland because there\\'s maybe a puddle there, waters of the United States. Give me a break.</p>\\n<p>So we\\'re going to reduce the size of government, but we\\'re also going to reduce the scope of government.</p>\\n<p>And in Florida, I\\'ve actually delivered on this, Florida has the lowest percentage of state government workers per capita in the country, and the cost of our state government employees is the lowest in the country.</p>\\n<p>No wonder why we\\'re paying down debt while we\\'re cutting taxes for people. That\\'s the way to do it. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, 15-second point of clarification. The question was whether or not working families would pay the same amount...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They would pay...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> ... as billionaires?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They would pay less than what they\\'re paying now. The way I view it is, OK -- and you\\'d exempt people -- so you would pay no tax for -- for working-class people. It would only be as you get above. Because I think the first $40,000, $50,000 grand, that\\'s just to subsist. And even some places, you can\\'t even do that.</p>\\n<p>So you would have no tax up to a certain point, and then it would just be a single rate. So if somebody...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... makes $100,000, they pay a certain amount. If someone makes $200,000, they pay...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They make twice as much, and they pay twice as much.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, first of all, you just can\\'t trust what he says. I mean, that\\'s the biggest thing. We don\\'t have a grocery tax in South Carolina. And I never once raised taxes, period.</p>\\n<p>But what I will tell you is, it is to call into question, why did he promise he\\'d never raise the debt limit and he turned around and he raised it?</p>\\n<p>And then you want to go, and you see one side of what he says early on, and then he changes it. So here he goes and he says that he is all for energy independence. He wants to get the EPA out of the way. Well, why did he run on the fact that he wanted to ban fracking and ban offshore drilling?</p>\\n<p>Why did he go and author that legislation to eliminate the renewable fuel standard that so -- that matters so much?</p>\\n<p>And why now is he suddenly coming to Iowa and saying, \"Oh, never mind, I don\\'t mean all of that?\"</p>\\n<p>Why did he call Trump and say that he wanted him to stop drilling nine miles into federal waters? Why is he now saying this?</p>\\n<p>Why do you come to the people of Iowa and say one thing when you campaigned and, on day two of your office, you banned fracking; you banned offshore drilling,; you turned around and authored and led the charge on banning the renewable fuel standards...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yeah...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You\\'ve got to stand up for those things that you did.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You\\'ve been -- you\\'ve been beating that dead horse -- that\\'s been the...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Because it\\'s true, Ron. It\\'s true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We\\'re looking forward to be able to open up energy production, and definitely here in the Midwest, with biofuels. I\\'m the only one that checked all the boxes from the Iowa renewable fuel standard, because I\\'ve actually visited all 99 counties. I\\'ve actually shown up to people\\'s farms. I\\'ve sat and I\\'ve listened to people about what they\\'re going through, how their economy is structured and how it\\'s important that we\\'re producing energy here in the United States.</p>\\n<p>I never want to go hat in hand, like Biden has done, to Venezuela or Saudi and begging for energy. We\\'re going to be able to open up production. We\\'re going to choose Midland over Moscow. We\\'re going to choose the Marcellus Shale over the mullahs. And we\\'re going to choose the Bakken over Beijing.</p>\\n<p>Energy independence isn\\'t even -- it\\'s not -- it\\'s good for consumers. It\\'s good to reduce inflation. And it\\'s one of the best things we can do for our national security. So we\\'ll do that on day one, and we are going to reverse Biden\\'s green new deal and the electric vehicle mandates. We\\'ll save the American automobile.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>This has been one of the biggest years for illegal border crossings into the United States. Last month alone, 225,000 migrants illegally crossed the southern border. It\\'s a record high, overwhelming the Border Patrol resources that are already stretched thin. Mayors across the country say their cities are being pushed to a breaking point.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, former President Trump famously promised to build a wall on the southern border. He obviously did not get that done. You have promised to finish the job. How will you succeed where he failed?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We will build a wall. We will actually have Mexico pay for it, in the way that I thought Donald Trump was. We\\'re going to charge fees on remittances that workers send to foreign countries, billions of dollars. We\\'ll build the wall.</p>\\n<p>He also promised record deportations. Donald Trump deported fewer people than Barack Obama did when he was president. Biden\\'s let in 8 million people just in four years. They all have to go back. We have to enforce the rule of law in this country.</p>\\n<p>Think about what\\'s happening to our country. Just this week, we saw the news that a high -- that a school in Brooklyn, New York, had the kids stay home. They were not able to go to school, told you can\\'t go get an in-person education. Why? Because their -- the city\\'s commandeering the school to house illegal aliens in it.</p>\\n<p>Talk about putting Americans last. You\\'re putting these kids out of an education because you can\\'t control the border?</p>\\n<p>Biden has failed in this endeavor. He has not taken care that the laws of this country be faithfully executed.</p>\\n<p>Do not trust Nikki Haley with illegal immigration. That\\'s like having the fox guard the hen house. She\\'s on tape at the Aspen Institute -- she\\'ll say she didn\\'t say it -- she was chastising conservatives, saying it\\'s disrespectful to illegal aliens to say that they\\'re criminals.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re violating the law. It\\'s disrespectful when people come to this country illegally and impose burdens on our communities and run drugs into this country. That\\'s what\\'s disrespectful.</p>\\n<p>She\\'s weak on immigration. She\\'s bankrolled by people who want open borders. And she said there shouldn\\'t be a limit on immigration; you should work with corporate CEOS...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thanks, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That is pale pastels. That is warmed-over...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you so much.</p>\\n<p>So, Governor Haley...[<i>cheering and applause</i>]... Governor DeSantis and also Donald Trump are attacking you for that comment in 2015 in which you said undocumented immigrants should not be called -- quote -- \"criminals.\"</p>\\n<p>At the time, the full context is you said -- quote -- \"We don\\'t need to talk about them as criminals. They\\'re not. They\\'re families that want a better life, and they\\'re desperate to get here\" -- unquote.</p>\\n<p>Do you still feel that way?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I saw them. When I was at the United Nations, I saw them. That doesn\\'t mean we should let them into our country.</p>\\n<p>I mean, first of all, I will tell you that, when I was governor of South Carolina, we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country. Obama sued us over it, and we won. We fought Obama on illegal immigration. We fought Obama on migrant kids. We fought Obama on Syrian refugees. We fought Obama on Guantanamo Bay prisoners.</p>\\n<p>I have always said we are a country of laws. The second we stop being a country of laws, we give up everything this country was founded on.</p>\\n<p>But I will tell you, in passing that toughest illegal immigration law in the country, we passed E-Verify, which I want to take national, which is where businesses have to prove that the people they hire are in this country legally. I passed it within six months of being governor. Ron didn\\'t pass it for five years.</p>\\n<p>He only waited to pass it when he decided to run for president. What we need to do is not just ban a wall. We need to put 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. We need to defund sanctuary cities once and for all, no more safe havens for illegal immigrants.</p>\\n<p>We need to make sure we go back to the remain-in-Mexico policy, so that no one even steps foot on U.S. soil. And instead of catch-and- release, we need to go to catch-and-deport. That\\'s the only way we will stop the incentives of these illegal immigrants coming across.</p>\\n<p>Biden turned around and gave half-a-million Venezuelans temporary protective status. That\\'s half-a-million driver\\'s licenses, half-a- million Social Security numbers. All that does is incentivize them to pick up the phone...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... call their family members, and tell them to come on ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She did bring...[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>When she was governor, she did bring Syrian refugees, and she got criticized for that.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> That is not true.

In fact, you have got them from China, Iran, Russia, the Middle East. When I was down there a couple years ago, because I have sent people down there, you had people from Libya and Haiti.</p>\\n<p>This is a ticking time bomb for this country. There are, of course, going to be terrorist cells that have come in. It\\'s like the lowest- cost way to be able to harm this country. Just send people across the southern border.</p>\\n<p>Nikki Haley also opposed the border wall in 2016. She said that -- she ridiculed it when Donald Trump was for that. I\\'m telling you, you need a wall. You can\\'t trust politicians to do this. If the wall\\'s there, it\\'s a physical fact of life. And it\\'s a huge step to restoring this country\\'s sovereignty.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis. Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Go to DeSantislies.com. I said, you can\\'t just build a wall. You have to do more than build a wall. It was having the wall and everything else. You can\\'t trust what Ron is saying.</p>\\n<p>But this is a bigger issue. This is more than him just constantly being desperate and throwing things on me. This is the fact that we have to realize my parents came here legally. They came the right way 50 years ago. They put in the time. They put in the price. They are offended by what\\'s happening on the border.</p>\\n<p>And my mom would always say, if they don\\'t follow the laws to come into this country, they won\\'t follow the laws when they are in this country. And we have to start treating this like it is. This is putting harm on our schools, on our hospitals. Taxpayers are paying for it. You see these mayors are now upset about it.</p>\\n<p>The only reason Eric Adams is now upset, why? He shouldn\\'t be a sanctuary city then. That\\'s why we have to defund sanctuary cities. Now Governor Abbott finally did to them what\\'s been happening to Texas for so long. We have got to put an end to this. It\\'s dangerous, and it doesn\\'t even count the fentanyl that\\'s happening.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you. Thank you, Governor. Thank you. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, there are more than 10 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States, according to Pew Research.</p>\\n<p>Will any of them be allowed to stay in the United States under your administration?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The number of people that will be amnestied when I\\'m president is zero.</p>\\n<p>We cannot do an amnesty in this country. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>First of all, all it\\'s going to do is cause more people to want to come illegally. So you have got to enforce the law. It\\'s got to be consistent. People got to know it\\'s there.</p>\\n<p>You also have to remove benefits for people who are here illegally. California, you can go, illegal alien, and you get free health insurance coverage. You\\'re here illegally, and they\\'re doing that? We should not let states provide these benefits.</p>\\n<p>In Florida, obviously, we don\\'t do that. We don\\'t allow the driver\\'s license and all that. But some states do. And it creates a magnet for people coming in. So, federally, no benefits, no enticements to come in, and then the states, we\\'re going to crack down on sanctuary states and sanctuary cities.</p>\\n<p>And I showed the hypocrisy of all this back in 2022 because we have a program to transport illegal aliens to sanctuary jurisdictions. And one of the places we sent 52, beautiful, liberal Martha\\'s Vineyard.</p>\\n<p>And you know what? These are folks that were on their high horse, saying how they were sanctuary jurisdiction, saying nobody is illegal. All refugees are welcome. That\\'s what they had in their town. The minute even 50 came up, they called the state of emergency and deported them off the island the next day. How do you think Texas feels? How do you think all these other communities feel that are overwhelming -- being overwhelmed?</p>\\n<p>So, we cannot have liberal elites in this country imposing policies on the rest of us that they are not willing to deal with the consequences of them.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, by the -- when you\\'re President, will any of the more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. be allowed to stay in the country under your administration?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You have to deport them. And the reason you have to deport them is they\\'re cutting the line. You\\'ve got people who have done this and tried to go through the right way. You can\\'t have them go and jump the line, and suddenly do that. And that is actually what will get them to stop coming, is when they do realize they get to the wall and they have to turn around and go back. It\\'s a dangerous process of what happens for them to try and migrate here.</p>\\n<p>But, when I was at the United Nations, and we had this, which is another reason why we need to have Trump here defending himself and talking about what he would do going in the future, because it\\'s a problem. I was on the ground in Honduras and Guatemala. And what we saw as a lot of the reason why they were coming from there is because of gangs and drugs. And so, what we did was we had our military go and train them on how to deal with gangs. We went and put drug boats on the water to keep the drugs from coming. But, we said you have to have them processed from here. You can\\'t have them come. We were able to stop that flow. We\\'ve got to go back to do that. But, we need to end it once and for all. Donald Trump didn\\'t do that. That\\'s why he needs to be here debating on the stage right now.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor, thank you. Let\\'s turn to foreign policy. You have expressed different visions for how the U.S. should approach the international complex. And I want to start with Ukraine. It\\'s been nearly two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and there is still no end in sight to that war. Governor Haley, you say that this is a \"war about freedom that Ukraine must win.\" Governor DeSantis says, \"We need to bring this war to an end.\" Do you believe he shares your commitment to a Ukrainian victory?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Nobody knows what he believes, because when President Obama was in office, he supported foreign aid to Ukraine. Now, he is copying Trump and trying to act like he doesn\\'t want to support Ukraine. But, let me tell you why Ukraine should matter. First of all, I don\\'t think we should give cash to any country, friend or foe, because you can\\'t follow it. You can\\'t hold it accountable. I don\\'t think we need to put troops on the ground. And Ukrainians want to win this themselves.</p>\\n<p>But, dictators always say, always do what they say they\\'re going to do. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. They did. Russia said they were going to invade Ukraine. They -- we watched it. China says Taiwan is next. We better believe them. Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. Those are NATO countries, and that puts America at war. This is about preventing war. It\\'s always been about preventing war.</p>\\n<p>If we support Ukraine, that\\'s only 3.5 percent of our defense budget. Biden and no one else is telling the American people the truth about that. The Europeans have put in more than that, and they should. It\\'s their neighborhood. But, this is a pro-American freedom-loving country. And we better remember that you have to be a friend to get a friend. And we needed a lot of friends, September 12. We\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re having the backs of the right friends, because if Russia wins, China wins. There is a reason the Taiwanese want us to help the Ukrainians. And that\\'s because they know if Ukraine wins, China won\\'t invade Taiwan. This is about preventing war.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I supported Trump\\'s policy vis-a-vis Russia, Ukraine, and it was successful. You know, the Biden policy has not been. But, Nikki Haley is basically a carbon copy of what Biden is. It\\'s an open-ended commitment. They want another $108 billion. They will not tell you when the -- they have achieved their goal. And this is going to go on maybe hundreds of billions more into the future. I think a lot of people have died. We need to find a way to end this, because our priorities for national security, of course, the border, which we talked about, and people like Nikki Haley care more about Ukraine\\'s border than she does about our own southern border, which is wrong.</p>\\n<p>But, we also have to look at what\\'s the top threat to this country. It\\'s the Chinese Communist Party. We are not doing what we need to do to have adequate hard power in the Indo-Pacific. And here is the thing. We don\\'t have enough resources, being $35 trillion in debt, to continue doing hundreds of billions of dollars. We got to focus on our issues here at home.</p>\\n<p>And we\\'ve got to deal with the top threat that we face, which is China.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> And then I wonder why you raised the debt when you were in Congress, because we\\'re all paying for that.</p>\\n<p>What I will tell you is, this is the lie they\\'re telling the American people over and over again. It is so wrong to say this. They\\'re saying you have to choose between Ukraine or Israel, or Israel and -- and securing the border. Supporting Ukraine is 3.5 percent of our budget. I don\\'t want cash going. It\\'s equipment and it\\'s ammunition. If we support Ukraine and Israel, that\\'s only 5 percent of our defense budget. If we support...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So you\\'re going to borrow that?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> If we support Ukraine, Israel, and secure the border, that\\'s less than 20 percent of Biden\\'s green subsidies. You do not have to choose when it comes to national security. This is about keeping Americans safe. This is about preventing war. This is about keeping our military men and women from having to fight a war. And you only do that when you focus on national security, not telling lies to the American people that they have to choose. That is wrong. That\\'s never been the case. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Here is the problem with what she\\'s saying. She -- she doesn\\'t articulate how this comes to an end, except she was asked after the last debate by, I believe, Megyn Kelly, and she said, you bring to it an end by bringing Ukraine into NATO. But, of course, we\\'re a NATO country. So if you bring Ukraine into NATO, that puts the United States at war. Megyn said that to her, and then she basically gave a word salad as to how you go from there.</p>\\n<p>So they have sent cash. She supports this $106 billion that they\\'re trying to get through Congress. Where is some of that money going? They\\'ve done tens of billions of dollars to pay salaries for Ukrainian government bureaucrats. They\\'ve paid pensions for Ukrainian retirees with your tax dollars?</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve got homeless veterans. We have all these problems. This is the U.N. way of thinking that we\\'re somehow globalists and we have unlimited resources to do. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>You know, I think here\\'s the problem. You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations, but you can\\'t take the United Nations out of the ambassador. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, I have never said that we should give salaries or benefits or anything else to Ukrainians. I have said it again, Ron, so stop lying. DeSantislies.com.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But you supported the aid packages.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So you go -- I did not support the aid package. I support equipment and ammunition going to Ukraine. I think it is incredibly important that we\\'re honest and say we have to focus on national security. Don\\'t go and lie to the American people to make them think we can\\'t do this.</p>\\n<p>You turned around and raised the debt limit. You\\'re the one that\\'s talked about, look at what you did to Florida. But think about the fact that he is talking about where is this money going to come from. You -- the best way to tell about a candidate is to see how they\\'ve run their campaign.</p>\\n<p>He has blown through $150 million. I don\\'t know how you do that. Through his campaign, he has nothing to show for it. He spent more money on private planes than he has on commercials trying to get Iowans to vote for him. If you can\\'t manage a campaign, how are you going to manage a country? Which is exactly...[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, listen, I\\'m proud of -- I\\'m proud that in the state of Florida, we\\'re ranked number one for economy of all 50 states by CNBC. Number one...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest cost of living.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... in education. She was ranked number 50 in education...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... when she was governor of California (ph)...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest insurance in the country.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, he...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... wasn\\'t able to do school choice. She didn\\'t deliver big tax cuts. We\\'re also number one for net end migration, number one for GDP growth amongst large states, number one for talent development, number one for new business formations, and on and on it goes.</p>\\n<p>So the success we\\'ve had in Florida, I can cite the statistics. It\\'s important. But just look at how people are voting with their feet. They\\'re leaving California. They\\'re leaving Illinois, New York, all these states, and they\\'re coming to Florida in record numbers because we\\'re doing it right.</p>\\n<p>And not only have I cut taxes big time, where she didn\\'t as governor of South Carolina, we\\'ve paid down 25 percent of our state\\'s debt. That\\'s how you manage the third-largest state in this country. Just imagine if we could do that for the United States of America. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So thank you. Let\\'s stay on foreign policy. I want to turn to the Israel-Hamas war. You both have said that you unequivocally support Israel. You both have called for the complete elimination of Hamas.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, there are real disagreements within Israel about how to handle what happens in Gaza after the war against Hamas is over. Some Israeli cabinet officials are pushing for the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza. Governor Haley told CNN last week she does not support that. Do you?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So we\\'ve got to support Israel in word and in deed, in public and in private. And they need to be able to finish the job. Joe Biden is kneecapping them. He\\'ll say one thing, then he goes and his base doesn\\'t like Israel, so he has got to do all these other things. This is a time to recognize that they\\'ve suffered the most deaths of Jews, murder of Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas wants a second Holocaust. They want to annihilate the state of Israel. So I think to be a good ally, you back them in the decisions that they\\'re making with respect to Gaza.</p>\\n<p>Look, there\\'s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you\\'re doing this. But for us to be sitting in Washington second guessing them, I don\\'t think that\\'s the right way.</p>\\n<p>We also have a disagreement. Governor Haley and I, when she was at the U.N., she supported the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs. The problem with that is the Palestinian Arabs don\\'t recognize Israel\\'s right to exist as a Jewish state. So doing a two-state solution doesn\\'t create something that\\'s going to lead to a lasting peace. It creates a stepping stone for Israel\\'s destruction.</p>\\n<p>So under no circumstances as president am I going to pressure Israel to risk their security to do a so called two-state solution. She was wrong when she embraced that. And we\\'re right to say we trust Israel to make these decisions. They\\'re a good ally of ours. We should trust their judgment on these sensitive issues.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, 15 seconds, 15 seconds clarification. Do you support the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So as president, I am not going to tell them to do that. I think there\\'s a lot of issues with that. But if they make the calculation that to avert a second holocaust, they need to do that. I think some of these Palestinian Arabs, Saudi Arabia should take some.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Egypt should take some. They\\'ve never been willing to accept any of these facts in their own neighborhood.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor. Thank you, governor. Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, we need to understand the reason we need to support Israel is Israel\\'s a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. They are the tip of the spear when it comes to defeating terrorism. It has never been that Israel needs America. It has always been that America needs Israel.</p>\\n<p>When I was at the United Nations, I fought every day for Israel. And if you would have listened to what I said at the United Nations, a two-state solution wasn\\'t something that was possible because Israel would always come to the table and the Palestinians wouldn\\'t.</p>\\n<p>But right now, we have to make sure that Israel has the support that it needs. There should be three things. Give Israel whatever it wants to get the job done. Two, eliminate Hamas once and for all. And three, do whatever it takes to bring the hostages home.</p>\\n<p>But it\\'s really rich that Ron is going to act like he suddenly cares for Israel when he brought the person to Iowa that\\'s the most anti- Israel Republican in the state, the person that went and voted against Israel\\'s right to exist in Congress, the person that voted with the squad against antisemitism on college campuses.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> And you brought that person --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- to Iowa to go and campaign with.

I mean, that\\'s just cheap garbage. But here\\'s the thing. When the attack --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> -- happened against Israel, I knew it was going to be a big deal for Florida. We have one of the largest Israeli American populations in the country, and we\\'ve been a haven for orthodox Jews in particular since I\\'ve been governor. And you know what? Biden wasn\\'t helping Americans get out of the war zone. These are people that were stranded. So I did an executive order. We scrambled planes and we rescued over 700 Americans from Israel and brought them back safely to the state of Florida. You got to step up and you got to lead when things like this are happening.</p>\\n<p>We also have gone after the antisemitism on our campuses. We did that early in my administration. You didn\\'t see our college presidents doing some of the things that you\\'ve seen.</p>\\n<p>I just announced in the state of the state address yesterday or two days ago that we are going to say not just for Jewish students, anyone who\\'s having religious, being persecuted or being marginalized because of their faith in any college around the country, we\\'re going to waive the transfer requirements so that people can come to Florida and be safe.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> What they are doing to Jewish students has been reprehensible.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We\\'re not going to let it out.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So there are -- I\\'m coming to you. There are growing fears of this war escalating into a broader regional conflict. And, Governor Haley, just yesterday the U.S. Navy shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by Iranian backed militants in the Red Sea. Iranian backed militants are now also attacking U.S. and western interests in Syria and Iraq. Your fellow South Carolinian Republican senator Lindsey Graham is calling for the U.S. to conduct retaliatory strikes inside Iran. Would you order strikes inside Iran?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, notice Ron didn\\'t say anything about the fact that he did bring that most anti-Israel Republican into this state to campaign. He also hasn\\'t told you that the only Republican Jewish state legislator left his campaign because he wasn\\'t dealing with the neo-Nazi marches and wasn\\'t dealing with antisemitism properly.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to Iran, what we have to understand, there would be no Hamas without Iran. There would not be Houthis without Iran. There wouldn\\'t be Hezbollah without Iran. And when you look at the strikes that are happening in Iraq and Syria, that is because of Ron. They\\'re pulling the puppet strings.</p>\\n<p>What we need to do is the idea that we\\'ve had over 130 strikes on our men and women in Iraq and Syria is unconscionable. We\\'re supposed to have their backs. And Biden has been slow. He\\'s been hiding in a corner and he hasn\\'t dealt with it.</p>\\n<p>We need to go and take out every bit of the production that they have that\\'s allowing them to do those strikes. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. And you can\\'t do that if you have a secretary of defense that is in ICU and the president doesn\\'t even know about it.</p>\\n<p>Look, there\\'s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you\\'re doing this. But for us to be sitting in Washington second guessing them, I don\\'t think that\\'s the right way.</p>\\n<p>We also have a disagreement.

He also hasn\\'t told you that the only Republican Jewish state legislator left his campaign because he wasn\\'t dealing with the neo-Nazi marches and wasn\\'t dealing with antisemitism properly.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to Iran, what we have to understand, there would be no Hamas without Iran. There would not be Houthis without Iran. There wouldn\\'t be Hezbollah without Iran. And when you look at the strikes that are happening in Iraq and Syria, that is because of Ron. They\\'re pulling the puppet strings.</p>\\n<p>What we need to do is the idea that we\\'ve had over 130 strikes on our men and women in Iraq and Syria is unconscionable. We\\'re supposed to have their backs. And Biden has been slow. He\\'s been hiding in a corner and he hasn\\'t dealt with it.</p>\\n<p>We need to go and take out every bit of the production that they have that\\'s allowing them to do those strikes. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. And you can\\'t do that if you have a secretary of defense that is in ICU and the president doesn\\'t even know about it.</p>\\n<p>What bothers me is, how does Biden not talk to his secretary of defense every single day, knowing that we have a war in Europe, a war in the Middle East, that we have our American military with strikes going on them; we\\'ve got brain injuries.</p>\\n<p>My husband is deployed right now. As a military spouse, the idea that the secretary of defense would not even be in contact with the president, much less in contact with his staff, is unforgivable.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> After the attacks against Israel, anyone with half a brain knows Iran is behind this. They fund Hamas. They fund Hezbollah. We did a special session of the legislature down in Florida. We expanded sanctions against Iran. If we were our own country, we\\'d be the 14th largest economy in the world.</p>\\n<p>The root of this is Biden came into office and he relaxed the sanctions on Iran. They\\'ve had massive amounts of money flooding into their country, just like under the Obama administration. They take that money and they use it to fund jihad around the world.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m the only one running for president that served in the armed forces. I deployed to Iraq back in 2007, 2008. So I understand what our -- what our military goes through. I would never put our troops in harm\\'s way, like Biden is doing in the Middle East, without defending them with everything they got.</p>\\n<p>If you harm a hair on the head of one of our servicemembers, you are going to be -- have hell to pay. He\\'s leaving them out to dry, and I think it\\'s disgraceful for a commander in chief to do that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.

Stay with us.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate live from Drake University in Iowa.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s talk about a big question in the Republican Party right now. And that is, what is the role of government, and should it use its power to go after businesses and private entities that take actions that don\\'t align with conservative values?</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, you used your powers in Florida to take on Disney after the company criticized an education bill that you signed into law. How does that square with the traditional conservative view that small, limited government is best?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The proper role of government, if it means every -- anything, it\\'s to protect our kids.</p>\\n<p>And I have stood for the innocence of our kids. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>It is wrong -- it is wrong to sexualize the curriculum. It\\'s wrong -- my wife and I, we have got a first grader, a kindergarten and a preschooler.</p>\\n<p>This is something that\\'s important to us personally. It\\'s wrong to tell a kindergartner, like Disney wanted to do, that you can change your gender or tell a third grader that you\\'re born in the wrong body. So I stood up against -- yes, the media didn\\'t like it, the left didn\\'t like it, and Disney didn\\'t like it.</p>\\n<p>And they\\'re the 800-pound gorilla in the state of Florida. Most people, most corporate Republicans would have caved. I stood and I fought for the kids. We took on Disney, and we defeated that and we won that fight and our kids are better off.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley sided with Disney. She invited them to South Carolina, even though they were involved in transing kids. That is not what we need to do. But I think that\\'s similar. She is representative of this corporatist element of the party. For example, she supported $900 million in subsidies to Boeing when she was in South Carolina. And then, when she got out of office, she took a seat on their board, and she made millions of dollars. Then she gave speeches, paid speeches, to a lot of Wall Street interests, didn\\'t publish what she said. We don\\'t know what she promised them.</p>\\n<p>And she made millions of dollars doing that. Now they\\'re the ones that are funding her campaign. So we need to stand up for the people, and not bow down to woke corporations. And we know Nikki Haley will cave to the woke mob every single time. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, a response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people.</p>\\n<p>And what we don\\'t need is government politicizing anything. The first thing I will say is, again, DeSantislies.com, because I have never said anything related to the transgender stuff he says. I have always fought to protect kids. I have always said that boys need to go into boys\\' bathrooms, girls need to go into girls\\' bathrooms, that we shouldn\\'t have any gender transitions before the age of 18.</p>\\n<p>Just like we don\\'t have tattoos before the age of 18, we shouldn\\'t have gender transformation or puberty blockers. But I will tell you that it\\'s really interesting that Ron talks about this -- Disney, because Disney has been woke for a long time.</p>\\n<p>They were against the immigration situation that Trump was doing. They were against the Paris climate agreement when I did it. They were against the pro-life bill in Georgia. Ron didn\\'t have any problem with that. As a matter of fact, he gave them the largest corporate subsidies in Florida history.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That\\'s false.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> He had tech exemptions that he gave -- didn\\'t give any tech exemptions to anybody but Disney.</p>\\n<p>Yet, when they went and criticized him, he got thin-skinned and suddenly started to fight back. We don\\'t need government fighting against our private industries. We are not woke in South Carolina. I will always invite businesses to come to South Carolina.</p>\\n<p>But the one thing you don\\'t do is, government doesn\\'t bully our businesses. And that can\\'t happen. And Ron has determined anybody that offends him...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... he goes after them, and he will use government...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She just said she\\'s always fought to protect kids. But when she was governor of South Carolina, they had a bill to protect girls from men going into the bathroom. She killed it. And she has bragged about it for years that that happened. She didn\\'t stand up and fight the kids. She caved to the Chamber of Commerce and the corporations.</p>\\n<p>She said she is against the surgeries for minors. That wasn\\'t what she said this summer. She was...</p>\\n<p>HALEY Desantislies.com.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She was asked about it, it\\'s on video. And she said the law should stay out of it. I -- I criticized her in the last debate. She took a lot of heat. So then she has flipped and said that there now should be the law involved. She said she supports a federal law. I\\'m glad she\\'s come to the right thing.</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the deal, it goes back to that young kid in the town hall that she had where he said, Nikki Haley, you are the new John Kerry, you are for it before you were against it. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s a shame that we had to put up Desantislies.com. Honestly, if he would spend as much time trying to prove why he thinks he would be a good president, he would be doing a lot better in the polls. The reason that he spent and blown through $150 million and gone down in the polls is because he spent more time trying to lie about me than he is about telling the truth about himself.</p>\\n<p>I have never been...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But you didn\\'t kill the bathroom bill.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I have never said that we should have any gender operations or surgeries.

We had a handful of kids that may have had that issue. And what I made very clear at that time in the state is girls go into girls bathrooms, boys go into boys bathrooms. And if there are any other exceptions, they use a private bathroom.</p>\\n<p>I have fought for women\\'s sports and making sure that biological boys are not in women\\'s sports. And I\\'ll continue to do that. I have always said we have to raise strong girls. Strong girls become strong women. Strong women become strong leaders.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> None of that happens if we have biological boys...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley -- Governor Haley, according to the U.S. Department of Education in 2017, the year you left office, South Carolina schools ranked in the bottom 10 nationwide in both reading and math scores. Given that, why should voters concerned about K through 12 education support you rather than other Republicans?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Because I think what we did was we knew that there was an issue. We knew in South Carolina if a child couldn\\'t read by third grade they were four times less likely to graduate high school. So what we did is, we started holding kids back instead of pushing them forward. We brought in their parents. We did reading remediation. And we set them up for success.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve got to do that all over the country. We only had 31 percent of eighth graders in the country are proficient in reading, 27 percent of eighth graders are proficient in math. If we don\\'t do something, we\\'re going to be in a world of hurt 10 years from now.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s why I want to take as many federal programs from D.C. as we can and send them down to the state level. Think education. We can move a lot of K through 12 programs down to the state level, reduce the strings that are attached, and that way states can handle it themselves. People in Iowa know best what types of education they need.</p>\\n<p>Secondly, parents should decide what types of education their children get, what mode of education. And we should have complete transparency in the classroom. No parent should ever wonder what\\'s being said or taught to their child in the classroom. That\\'s why we\\'ll have all of the curriculums online for every parent to see.</p>\\n<p>And we need to start putting vocational classes back in our high schools. Let\\'s teach our kids how to do things. We did that in South Carolina. We had apprenticeships. We taught our kids how to build the things we are making.</p>\\n<p>When we start putting education back in the states and away from D.C., that\\'s when we\\'ll start to see that we are going back to the basics. We\\'re doing what parents want. And we\\'re doing what the industries...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... in that state need.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, I\\'m coming to you right now. Governor DeSantis, you have supported limits on what subjects can be taught and how, including American history in Florida schools. You have also made it easier to remove books from public school libraries. You say you want to, quote, \"make America Florida.\" Do you want to implement those Florida school policies nationwide?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I\\'ll get to that in a sec. So Nikki Haley said she wants parents to decide on the education. She campaigned for governor saying she was going to do school choice, to be able to give private scholarships, particularly to low-income families. And she was governor and never did it. She caved to the teachers union.</p>\\n<p>I delivered the biggest school choice expansion in the history of the United States. We beat the teachers union. We\\'ve even done paycheck protection so that school unions -- so that teachers aren\\'t force to do dues, and now they\\'re choosing other things. So we\\'ve done it right in Florida. And the results speak for themselves.</p>\\n<p>We have one of the top performing fourth grade reading and math in the country. And if you just took our charter school population, 365,000 kids, disproportionately low income, racial, ethnic minorities, if they were their own state, they\\'d be in the top five in performance. Everyone can succeed, but you\\'ve got to have a leader who\\'s going to fight the teachers unions and is going to deliver school choice.</p>\\n<p>Governor Kim Reynolds did that here in Iowa, who\\'s endorsed me. Nikki Haley did not. She failed. And if she can\\'t do it in the reddest state in the country of South Carolina, how are you going to be able to succeed in Washington, D.C.?</p>\\n<p>Now, in terms of what we\\'ve done, we believe in empowering parents, and there are certain standards about what\\'s age and developmentally appropriate. It\\'s wrong to have pornographic materials in fourth or fifth grade. And you know what\\'s happened? They\\'ll go to school board meetings all around the country. They\\'ll start reading it and they, oh, no, no, it\\'s too graphic. You can\\'t read it here. You can\\'t put it on the 6:00 news.</p>\\n<p>Well, if it\\'s not appropriate in a school board meeting and you can\\'t put on the 6:00 news, why are you jamming it down the throats of a fourth grader?</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor, just a point of clarification, do you want to implement Florida\\'s education policies nationwide?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> It depends on the policy. School choice universal, yes. I don\\'t want a nationalized curriculum. I think that that\\'s a bottom up thing. I want to get rid of the federal Department of Education, get that weight off the backs of the state and local governments. But we are going to do nationwide scholarships through the tax credits, and that\\'s going to bail out a lot of poor kids throughout this country.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I have fought for school choice in my entire career because I think parents know their children best, and I think we should always do that. That\\'s why we passed charter school legislation in our state. That\\'s why we empowered homeschoolers in our state. That\\'s why we changed the funding formula. So, we lifted up challenged areas without bringing down the wealthy areas.</p>\\n<p>We wanted school choice. I had a Republican legislature that wouldn\\'t do it, but we pushed hard to get that done. That doesn\\'t mean that we shouldn\\'t do it across the country. But what we have to do is we have to make it state centric. We\\'ve got to get these programs down to the state level. We\\'ve got to let the focus be on teachers. Teachers right now have to be the guidance counselors, the pastors, the nurses and everything in between. And, oh, by the way, they have to teach to a test. That\\'s not what teachers want. Teachers want to do what they were taught to do. And that means math, science, reading, history, English, arts. That\\'s it.</p>\\n<p>Schools can\\'t be all things to all kids. They need to let the parents parent. They need to let teachers teach. And we need to go back to the basics in education so we get our kids --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. I want to move on.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That is the problem, though. That word salad is the problem.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She said she\\'s always supported school choice and she failed to deliver. She blames other people. Leadership is about getting things done. Stop making excuses. Make it happen.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> If leadership is about getting things done, how did you blow through $150 million in your campaign, and you were down in the polls. You are not a man of word. No, I\\'m going to say --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think it\\'s very instructive about what Nikki Haley sees the world.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think I have the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, Governor Haley --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> What is more important here? She\\'s saying somehow that that\\'s not --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, it\\'s Governor Haley\\'s time. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think I hit a nerve. What I will tell you is, look, if you can\\'t manage a campaign -- it\\'s been a revolving door of political people in and out of his campaign. You\\'ve heard of campaign people going to blows with each other because they can\\'t all agree. $150 million, and he spent more on private planes than commercials. I flew commercial. I stayed in residence inns. We went and saved our money. We made sure we spent it right because you have to understand, it\\'s not your money, it\\'s other people\\'s money, and you have to know how to handle it. If he can\\'t handle the financial parts of a campaign, how is he going to handle the economy when it comes to the White House?</p>\\n<p>And he goes, and he has been demeaning me over and over again, telling lies, desantislies.com, because he thinks it makes him look bigger. But in the one basic thing, you\\'ve campaigned for president in one state, you\\'re invisible in New Hampshire, you\\'re invisible. In South Carolina, you\\'re in fifth place, you\\'ve got $150 million and you\\'ve gone down in the polls in Iowa. Why should we think you can manage or do anything in this country?</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> This is a great window into leadership because she focused on a lot of political process stuff, things that no voter cares about, and she couldn\\'t tell you why she failed to deliver school choice to people in her state after she promised it. So, she says somehow that is the indicative of me.</p>\\n<p>No, leadership is about producing results. We\\'ve produced the results in Florida. We did universal school choice. We\\'ve cut taxes, we banned sanctuary cities on and on down the line, everything I promised, I delivered. She doesn\\'t have a rationale for why she couldn\\'t get it done. That is poor leadership. You look at me. Everything I promised I would do, I\\'ve delivered. And you can expect nothing less when I\\'m the president of the United States.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re going to move on now.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I need to respond to that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, you want to talk about leadership, and he wants to go and demean and put down. Let me tell you what leadership is. Leadership is the fact that I went into South Carolina that had 11 percent unemployment rate. Leadership is the fact that we turned it into an economic powerhouse, building planes, building cars, building tires.</p>\\n<p>We were named the beasts of the southeast. We moved the 11 percent unemployment down to 4 percent. We announced jobs in every county in the state. We moved 35,000 people on welfare to work. We changed our prison system to where we now have the lowest recidivism rate in the country. We passed voter I.D. We passed tort reform. We did pension form. We paid down our debt. We cut taxes. We made sure that people were proud again. We did eVerify in the first six months, not five years, like Ron.</p>\\n<p>So, don\\'t go and pick on school choice and say that that\\'s leadership. When I got to the U.N., we cut a billion dollars off the top, and we took the kick me sign off of our backs, and America was respected again at the U.N. I know what leadership is.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re moving on to a topic, governors, that both of you have made central to your campaigns, and that is China. Governor Haley, American farmers were hurt by former President Trump\\'s trade war with China. As a result, his administration paid out $28 billion in subsidies to farmers. You have vowed to be even tougher than Donald Trump on China. If your trade policies also end up hurting America\\'s farmers, are you prepared to cut a check just like he did?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, that\\'s why Trump should be here on this debate stage. He should have to defend it. So, first of all, I\\'ve said China is our number one national security threat. I fought them every single day at the United Nations. I know what they\\'re capable of. The first thing we have to do is we have to make sure we stop selling them any land and we take back the land they already purchased. We need to go to our universities and we say, you either take Chinese money or you take American money but the days of taking both are over. We need to stop all of the technologies that are going to China. Biden approved 70 percent of them. Trump approved even more than that. We have to tell them we\\'re going to end all normal trade relations with them until they stop murdering Americans with fentanyl. And we need to make sure we build up our military.</p>\\n<p>But the biggest thing, I was very attached to China in terms of trade, and the one thing we\\'ll do is we won\\'t wait for the China to pull the rug out from under Iowans. What we\\'ll do is instead, we will move that trade to where we have friends. We will go and build partnerships, India, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Australia, Israel. We will go and move that trade over.</p>\\n<p>Right now, you can ask our farmers when they go and they buy from China, China orders, cancels the order, then goes and tries to buy it cheap. That\\'s what China does. Our farmers deserve better than that. We will get them trade deals.</p>\\n<p>When I was governor in South Carolina, we sold and we exported everything we were making in South Carolina. When I\\'m president, we will sell and export everything that\\'s being made in Iowa to those that are our friends, not our enemies.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor DeSantis, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The way you deal with China is threefold. One, we need more hard power in the Indo-Pacific. I\\'m a Navy guy. We need more sea power. We\\'re going to build that up and we\\'re going to have a strategy to deny their ability to invade Taiwan or to get beyond the first island chain. On the current course, they\\'re going to take advantage of Biden and we\\'re going to rue the day when that happens.</p>\\n<p>Second, we got to decouple our economy, particularly things that are significant to our national survival. And you\\'ve got to be methodical, strategic about it. There\\'s a lot of moving parts there. But we\\'re going to do.</p>\\n<p>Nikki Haley\\'s not going to be able to do that because a lot of her supporters make a lot of money in China. And so she\\'s going to talk tough, but she\\'ll cave on that.</p>\\n<p>And then also with here in the United States, she\\'s saying they shouldn\\'t be buying land and be in the universities. When she was governor of South Carolina, the state gave China land and they were in the universities. As governor in Florida, I banned China from buying land and we kicked them out of our universities. That\\'s what you want to do.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> DeSantislies.com, he has an economic development arm. You had an office in Hong Kong. On the website, it said that Florida is a great place for Chinese companies to do business. And then when we called you out on it, you had the website scrubbed. So, we know that that\\'s the case. What I will tell you is we need to focus on what we\\'re going to do to become less dependent on China, and we need to make sure that we look at it through a national security lens.</p>\\n<p>When we had COVID, everybody told you to wear a mask. It was made in China. They told you to take a COVID test, you turned it over, it was made in China. If you go down the drugstore aisle, all those medicines are made in China. We need to make sure we\\'re getting medicines made here or we need to get it from our friends so that we\\'re not, in any way, threatened.</p>\\n<p>But I\\'ll tell you, Ron continues to sit there and talk about China. He has done expansions in China. His biggest donor that is backed by China gave them $340,000. So, don\\'t go and talk about donors and money. Go to desantislies.com and we\\'ll tell you all about it.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Look, I know your record hurts. I know your record sometimes because you\\'re being -- you\\'re talking the opposite of what you did. You were made a big effort to bring them into the state.</p>\\n<p>They had land near military base. You were in front of the Chinese flags saying you work for them. You wrote a love letter to the ambassador. That\\'s well-documented. You were the number one Republican governor in the country.</p>\\n<p>And even people that on the media who are hostile to me, they look, they say they can\\'t find one instance of me as governor recruiting a Chinese company because I haven\\'t done it. It\\'s not been part of that.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Desantislies.com is on there. It\\'s on there.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And the Enterprise Florida, we actually eliminated.</p>\\n<p>So, here\\'s the thing though. She\\'s backed by companies like BlackRock. She\\'s backed by major companies on Wall Street. They make a lot of money in China. There\\'s a reason why you\\'re in the mess you are in terms of trying to deal with the inflation and everything because the elites in this country have sold out the middle of the country for China. She is part of that now. And she\\'s not going to stand up for you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> I want to ask about something that you mentioned you\\'ve been talking a lot about on the campaign trail, which is decoupling the U.S. economy with China\\'s. China is a top supplier of goods to the United States. The U.S. sells more than $150 billion of goods to China every year. Is it really possible to sever economic ties without inflicting major pain on American business and American consumers?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Sure it is, and it\\'s something that you\\'ve got to be strategic, you\\'ve got to be methodical about. You\\'ve got to focus on the things that are of national significance. For example, I don\\'t think it\\'s good idea that the pharmaceuticals come from there, things for our military weaponry, all these important things that if we got into a worldwide conflict, we\\'re going to ask China, who may be on the other side of that, to continue doing that.</p>\\n<p>So, you got to be smart about it. You got to recognize that you\\'re going to have to do some incentives here in this country, tax incentives, regulatory incentives. But I want to make things here again.</p>\\n<p>You know, I look around the country. There\\'s parts of Iowa that have been hollowed out, particularly in the eastern part. And I\\'ve talked to folks and seen what that did for the community. We were sold a bill of goods by a lot of elites in this country that somehow putting China and the WTO and granting a most favorite nation status was going to lead to our manufacturing exporting a bunch of stuff there. Instead, they\\'ve gobbled up so much more manufacturing.</p>\\n<p>I don\\'t think you can be a first rate power unless you have a very strong industrial base. So, we\\'re going to do that here. We\\'re going to work on workforce education. Not everyone needs to do a four-year Brick and Ivy University. That\\'s not the best way or only way for people to succeed. We\\'re going to do skilled trades. We\\'re going to do vocational. We\\'ve done that in Florida. It\\'s going to be a really, really big thing.</p>\\n<p>But I just think the middle of the country has to have those good- paying jobs and we can\\'t put the interest of some of the people on Wall Street over the interests of Americans on Main Street.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Let\\'s move on to Social Security. Let\\'s move on to Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, Social Security will be unable to pay full benefits in a decade if no action is taken.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, you have said that you\\'re not going to, quote, mess with Social Security, unquote. Does that mean you have committed to never raising the retirement age and never cutting benefits?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So, all seniors out there, promise has been made to you. You\\'ve paid into this. Every single paycheck that you\\'ve had your entire life they\\'ve taken money out of, and that promise needs to be fulfilled.</p>\\n<p>So, that will happen when I\\'m president. Of course, I have a lot of seniors in Florida that depend on Social Security. I know many of them. And I think back to my own grandmother who was -- lived until 91. Social Security was her sole source of income. So, promise made, promise kept.</p>\\n<p>You know, on the retirement age, you know, there used to be people would say, well, life expectancy is going up. Shouldn\\'t it mirror that? Well, the problem now in the last five years is life expectancy is going down. So, I don\\'t see how you can raise the retirement age when our life expectancy is collapsing in this country. That\\'s a huge problem in and of itself.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ll work with both sides of the aisle. We\\'ll work on something for the long-term strengthening, but I am not going to mess with seniors\\' benefits. In this high-inflation environment, groceries are going through the roof, rent is going through the roof, all these staples, and you get a cost of living adjustment, but that\\'s not enough to cover the costs that have been increased.</p>\\n<p>So, seniors are really strapped, particularly those that are on fixed income, and they have to know that we\\'re going to deliver when it comes to their Social Security check.</p>\\n<p>Now, we\\'re going to get inflation down. We\\'re going to get energy costs down. There\\'s going to be a lot of things that are going to help seniors, but I think seniors should know promise made will be a promise kept.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So just a point of clarification, 15 seconds, removing current seniors from the equation, you\\'re not saying that you\\'re committing to never raising the retirement age or cutting benefits.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I would never raise the retirement age in the face of a declining life expectancy. I mean, I think that that would be really bad. I mean, just think about it, that hurts blue collar folks. You get taxed your entire life, life expectancy is down. You may not even be recouping very many benefits. And so life expectancy is declining. That\\'s a big problem.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Three years in a row, he voted to raise life expectancy to 70 years old, three years in a row. Go to desantislies.com and you\\'ll see it. So, now suddenly he\\'s going to tell you because he\\'s running for president and he\\'s not going to do it, you can\\'t trust him.</p>\\n<p>What I\\'ll tell you is Social Security is going to go bankrupt in ten years. Medicare is going to go bankrupt in eight. He talks about taking care of seniors right now, Florida is the inflation hotspot. It\\'s the highest cost of living of any state in the country. Seniors are having to leave because they can\\'t afford it. It\\'s documented in desantislies.com.</p>\\n<p>What I\\'ll tell you we have to do is we have to keep our promises to senior years, but we also can\\'t put our head in the sand for those like Ron saying they\\'re not going to touch Social Security. That means they\\'re going to leave after four or eight years and leave it bankrupt. No.</p>\\n<p>What we do is we go to those in their 20s and say we\\'re going to change the retirement age to reflect life expectancy. Instead of cost of living increases, we do increases based on inflation. We\\'d limit benefits on the wealthy and we expand Medicare advantage plans with seniors. That\\'s how we\\'ll deal with --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> With reducing the benefits, when you do the change in calculation, reducing the benefits, let\\'s just put this in perspective, under her administration, you would have seniors getting less cost of living adjustments while your tax dollars are going to pay the pensions of Ukrainian bureaucrats.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> That\\'s not true. That\\'s such a lie, Ron.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You talk about putting Americans last. That is wrong. You\\'ve supported all that money going over there. So, let\\'s put our own people first.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You\\'re so desperate. You\\'re just so desperate.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, let him speak.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And she also said -- she said recently that the age of Social Security is way too low, and I criticized that. And then she was called on it. And then she said, she never said it, of course, you\\'re lying. And then, sure enough, you put on the interview where she\\'s there, splitting image, and she says it\\'s way too low.</p>\\n<p>So, we can play this song and dance. She has a record. She makes statements. And I think part of the problem with her candidacy is now that she\\'s getting scrutiny, she\\'s got this problem with ballistic podiatry, shooting herself in the foot every other day, saying things that now she doesn\\'t even take questions from people.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, you want to raise the retirement age for younger Americans, but you have not said what that age should be. Should voters in their 20s plan on working until they\\'re 70?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, he hasn\\'t answered the fact that he voted to raise the retirement age to 73 different times. He can call me whatever name and be demeaning as much as he wants. It doesn\\'t change the fact that Ron is lying because Ron is losing. Everybody in the country sees it for what it is.</p>\\n<p>So, what I\\'ll tell you is, yes, we\\'re going to take on -- we\\'re going to be responsible with it and we\\'re going to go to those in our 20s.</p>\\n<p>When I said the retirement age was too low, again, where he\\'s lying, it\\'s because if you go, and you can go to desantislies.com, I said it\\'s too low, if we\\'re going to look at those in their 20s. We have to go and start looking at what we can do to get out of this. We want to make sure that everybody who was promised gets it.</p>\\n<p>But we also want to make sure our kids have something when they get it, too. So, the way we do that is exactly how I laid it out. Then we\\'ll know what we\\'re looking at and then we can start focusing.</p>\\n<p>The other thing is we need to start cutting spending in D.C. We have to go back to pre-COVID levels. That\\'s why I\\'ll veto any spending bill that doesn\\'t take us back to pre-COVID levels. That will save us trillions. We\\'ve got to go into every agency, replace the head of every agency and send people into every agency.</p>\\n<p>I did that as governor. Pull down old regs, pull down old programs, get rid of any problem children and clean those agencies out and get them mission-focused. There is a lot of waste in D.C. You need an accountant to go in there and clean it up. But we\\'re not going to take away from anyone else and he\\'s yet to answer the fact that he voted three times to raise the retirement age.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Just a clarification, Governor Haley, in 15 seconds, should voters in their 20s plan on having to work until they\\'re 70?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> They should plan on their retirement age being increased, yes. We\\'re going to change it to reflect more of what life expectancy should be.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, one of the things that I think we disagree on, too, is Governor Haley has said Social Security is an entitlement, but it\\'s not an entitlement. You\\'re paying into it. It\\'s not a welfare program. You\\'re being taxed for this your whole life. And so to expect to have benefits on the backend, I don\\'t think that that\\'s too much.</p>\\n<p>The other thing I\\'d point out is Social Security for decades ran massive surpluses. What happened to those surpluses? The Congress spent the surpluses.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Yes, when you paid the debt.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They have a big problem with that. So, number one, we need term limits for members of Congress. Number two, we need a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Number three, we need to give the president a line item veto. And, number four, when you see all these Congressmen making a killing in the stock market, like Nancy Pelosi, she could run a very lucrative hedge fund, we need a 28th Amendment to the Constitution that says very simply Congress shall make no law respecting the citizens of the United States that does not also apply to members of Congress themselves.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> I want to turn now to the topic abortion, which, of course, has been hotly debated in this Republican primary campaign.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, last week Governor DeSantis said that former President Trump is not pro-life. Do you agree?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, look, I think that he did some pro-life things when he was president. You\\'d have to ask him. That\\'s why he should be on this debate stage.</p>\\n<p>Don\\'t ask me what President Trump thinks. You need to have him on this debate stage and ask him for yourself.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, look, I think that we\\'ve stood very strongly for a culture of life. Governor Reynolds is here. She has stood strongly for a culture of life and a national life protection. We\\'ve done it in the state of Florida. Donald Trump has attacked that.</p>\\n<p>What they did under Governor Reynolds here in Iowa, he said that that\\'s a, quote, terrible, terrible thing. I don\\'t know how you square that. He was at the March for Life when he was president his last year and he said that life\\'s a gift from God, that the unborn are made in the image of God and that you needed to have protections for that human life. And now saying it\\'s a terrible, terrible thing, he\\'s given a gift to the left to weaponize that against pro-lifers, and that\\'s wrong.</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the thing. Republicans need to do a better job of lifting up folks who are having children. It\\'s very difficult to raise kids in this environment. You need the help with medical care. You need the help with affordability, and we need the help with education, choice. You got to be pro-life for the whole life, and you got to have some compassion for what is going on in this country.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. Oh, I\\'m sorry. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor, yesterday in Iowa, you criticized Governor Haley on this issue of abortion. You said she\\'s, quote, indulged in left wing tropes and chastised pro-lifers. Do you believe Governor Haley is sufficiently pro-life?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think she\\'s been confused on the issue. I think she\\'s trying to speak to different groups with different things. But when she says things like pro-lifers need to stop talking about throwing women in jail, that\\'s a trope. No one I\\'ve ever met thinks that that\\'s something that\\'s appropriate. These women are in vulnerable situations. They don\\'t get any help a lot of times from these fathers who don\\'t want to be there supportive. A lot of times they don\\'t have resources themselves.</p>\\n<p>So, it\\'s a very difficult situation and we\\'ve got to have compassion for those situations. But I think when she starts bringing that in, that\\'s using the language of the left to try to attack pro-lifers.</p>\\n<p>So, I think that that is wrong. But at the end of the day, I do agree with her on this. Donald Trump should be on this stage. He owes it to you here in Iowa to explain this change he\\'s had in his positioning, to explain why he has a tough time saying whether a man can become a woman or not, to explain why he wants to build a billion dollar-plus big, beautiful, new FBI building right in the heart of the swamp in Washington, D.C. He needs to explain why he didn\\'t build the wall and why he added $7.8 trillion to the debt.</p>\\n<p>Every candidate needs to earn your vote. Nobody is entitled to your vote. And he comes in here every now and then, he does his spiel, and then he leaves. I\\'ve shown up to all 99 counties because it\\'s important. You\\'re a servant of the people. You are not a ruler over the people. And that\\'s the type of president that I will be for you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I didn\\'t hear the criticism from Ron about me for being pro- life, but I\\'m not surprised. It\\'s something that he does all day, every day. I am unapologetically pro-life, not because the Republican Party tells me to be, but because my husband is adopted and I\\'ve got my two sweet children sitting in front of me and I had trouble having both of them.</p>\\n<p>These fellows don\\'t know how to talk about abortion. I have said over and over again, the Democrats put fear in women on abortion and Republicans have used judgment. This is too personal of an issue to put fear or judgment.</p>\\n<p>Our goal should be how do we save as many babies as possible and support as many moms as possible. That\\'s what we\\'re going to focus on doing. We\\'re not going to demonize this issue anymore. We\\'re not going to play politics with this issue anymore. We\\'re going to treat it like the respectful issue that it is.</p>\\n<p>And the tropes that you want to talk about, you keep saying, where is anybody talking about putting a woman in jail or giving her the death penalty? South Carolina. There is legislation right now that would put a woman in jail if she got an abortion. That\\'s why I say that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>So, I do want to remind the viewers at home, both governors have mentioned that they believe that Donald Trump should be here defending his own record. I just want to remind everybody that he did qualify for this debate and he did not accept our invitation.</p>\\n<p>Both of you talked about how important it is to protect the U.S. Constitution. Two years after losing the 2020 election, Donald Trump wrote on social media about his baseless election lies, quote, a massive fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution, unquote. On that subject, former Vice President Mike Pence has said that on January 6th, 2021, Donald Trump put himself over the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, look, you take an oath to the Constitution, and I think what you\\'re seeing is Donald Trump basically said that the election was stolen. He went on and on talking about the election being stolen.</p>\\n<p>He said that January 6th was a beautiful day. I think January 6th was a terrible day and we should never want to see that happen again.</p>\\n<p>And I think we have to always be strong on the fact that, look, we want fair elections and we saw some discrepancies in those elections in 2020 that should be concerning. That\\'s why I passed voter I.D. in South Carolina. That\\'s why I think when absentee ballots go out, you should be able to verify signatures. That\\'s why I think ballots need to be counted on Election Day and you should get results on Election Day.</p>\\n<p>But that election, Trump lost it. Biden won that election. And the idea that he\\'s gone and carried this out forever to the point that he\\'s going to continue to say these things to scare the American people are wrong. We\\'ve seen a lot of states come together and do more election integrity bills. We need to do more than that. We still have three or four states that I\\'m worried about that don\\'t have that.</p>\\n<p>But at the end of the day, I will always defend and fight for the Constitution. That\\'s what we should do as Americans. I think what happened on January 6th was a terrible day and I think President Trump will have to answer for it.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, just a clarification, Governor, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I mean, I think that he says in January 6th was a beautiful day. I don\\'t think it was a beautiful day. I think you look at that. He thinks that he could go and bring in -- the fact that he wanted to change what the states did, the fact that he wanted to overturn the elections in D.C., those votes happen at the state level. You don\\'t ever allow in D.C. for those votes to be changed at the federal level.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> States rights matter.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> My role model for how to do the Constitution is George Washington. He said, the Constitution is the guide that I will never abandon. And I remember when I took an oath to be an officer in the U.S. Navy. You raise that hand, you put that left hand on the Bible. And it\\'s interesting, the oath doesn\\'t say that you\\'re going to defend the shores of the United States or engage in military conflict.</p>\\n<p>The oath simply says that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States. As President of the United States, you will preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. You can\\'t just terminate the Constitution. I mean, I know he does word vomit from time to time on social media, but, obviously, I will uphold the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>And I think it\\'s fine to criticize Donald Trump, and I know the media brings it up a lot. But you know who else deserves to be criticized? The people that violated the Constitution during COVID to lock people out of schools, to destroy businesses, to force masks on people, to try to force vaccines. I\\'m going to bring a reckoning to all these agencies, the CDC, the NIH, the FDA, they harm people in this country. And when Dr. Fauci said there was no learning loss for kids, that\\'s a disgrace.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> There\\'s a reckoning coming.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, let\\'s talk about how you view the powers of the presidency because your opponent, Donald Trump, was in court yesterday for a hearing on presidential immunity. And, Governor DeSantis, I\\'m wondering if you agree with the argument that Donald Trump\\'s lawyer made in court that a president should have immunity for any conduct in office, including, as the judge asked, ordering the assassination of a political rival unless the president gets impeached and convicted by the Senate for the offense first.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, obviously, that attorney gave the case away on that explanation. I think the D.C. Circuit is going to rule against Donald Trump on that issue. I\\'m not exactly sure what the outer limits are. I don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily been litigated. It\\'s not going to be an issue with me, because I\\'m always going to follow the Constitution. And we\\'re going to uphold the best traditions of the office. And I\\'m going to be a president you can be proud of.</p>\\n<p>I think it\\'s important that people would be able to look to the president and say, hey, that\\'s somebody that\\'s worthy of emulating. And so my wife and I, we just view ourselves to try to do well for our kids and to make sure they\\'re proud of us. And we set a good example. So, that\\'s what we would do in that situation.</p>\\n<p>But I think there\\'s a larger issue Republicans have got to think of. Donald Trump is going to lose that appeal. He\\'s going to end up going to trial in front of a stacked left-wing D.C. jury of all Democrats. What are the odds that he\\'s going to get through that? And that\\'s even talking about the validity of the charges. I don\\'t think he gets through that.</p>\\n<p>And so what are we going to do as Republicans in terms of who we nominate for president? If Trump is the nominee, it\\'s going to be about January 6th, legal issues, criminal trials. The Democrats and the media would love to run with that.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m not running for my issues. I\\'m running for your issues. We need to make this election a referendum on the failures of Joe Biden, the failures of the Democratic Party, and how we have the formula to engineer a great comeback for this country. That\\'s what I would do.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley, Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t hear the question.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> The question was, do you agree with the argument Donald Trump\\'s lawyer made in court that a president should have immunity for any conduct, including ordering the assassination of a political rival unless that president is impeached and convicted by Senate for the defense first?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> No, that\\'s ridiculous. That\\'s absolutely ridiculous. I mean, we need to use some common sense here. You can\\'t go and kill a political rival and then claim, you know, immunity from a President. I think we have to start doing things that are right. And you know,</p>\\n<p>Ron said we should have leaders that we can look up to. Well, then stop lying because nobody\\'s going to want to look up to you if you\\'re lying.</p>\\n<p>But what I do think we need to look at is what is what has President Trump done? You look at the last few years and our country is completely divided. It\\'s divided over extremes. It\\'s divided over hatred, it\\'s divided over the fact that people think that if someone doesn\\'t agree with you that they\\'re bad.</p>\\n<p>And now we have leaders in our country that decide who\\'s good and who\\'s bad, who\\'s right and who\\'s wrong. That\\'s not what a leader does. What a leader does is they bring out the best in people and get them to see the way forward.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s what we need in our country. We don\\'t need this chaos anymore. We need someone who\\'s going to be a new generational leader that brings sanity back to America.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you so much. We\\'ll see you then. Republican Presidential Debate live from Drake University. We\\'ll be back right after this.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Iowa, Drake University. Let\\'s start this with health care. Neither of you has released a detailed healthcare plan so we want to give some -- the voters here some insight into specifics of what you might do as President.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, as governor of South Carolina you chose not to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. Forty states including this one where we are in Iowa did expand Medicaid covering more than 18 million Americans. As President, would you allow those states to keep their expansions in place?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, the first thing is we have to look at the fact that how can we be the best country in the world with the most expensive health care in the world? And so the way we\\'re going to deal with it is we\\'re going to open it all up from the hospitals to the insurance companies to the doctor\\'s offices to the pharmaceuticals to the PBMs, make them have to show us everything.</p>\\n<p>Because right now, I can tell you, we take care of my parents. They\\'re 87 and 90. My dad is in the hospital right now. When my mom was in the hospital, a nurse came up to her to give her a couple of Tylenol. And she said, I don\\'t need them. And she said, honey, you might as well take them, because you\\'re going to pay for them anyway. When we got the bill from the hospital, no one talked to us about that.</p>\\n<p>Right now, you have insurance companies and hospitals deciding what it is for us. We\\'re going to take the patient out of the back seat and put them in the driver\\'s seat. We\\'re going to make sure that just like when you get your car fixed, and you go and they say, we can give you a temporary fix, and it\\'ll cost this much money, or we can give you a permanent fix, and it\\'s going to cost that much money. We\\'re going to go and make it transparent so that we can see everything so that they have to show us their words.</p>\\n<p>The second thing is we\\'re going to pass Tort Reform around this country. I did that in South Carolina. Doctors don\\'t give you those 10 tests because they want to. It\\'s for the 90 percent chance they\\'ll get sued. And then we\\'re going to go and eliminate Certificate of Need in this country. I did that in South Carolina, as well. That basically says if you have a hospital here, you can\\'t have another hospital for X number of miles.</p>\\n<p>They do the same thing for surgical centers, for nursing homes. We\\'re going to put competition back in health care so that health care is fighting for the patient. That way, services go up and costs go down.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor Haley, just a 15-second point of clarification. Would you allow the states that accepted Medicaid expansion to keep that?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, the problem with Medicaid is, it needs to be sent down as block grants. Governors can best decide how to do that. Whether they need to use it towards mental health, whether they need to use it towards support services.</p>\\n<p>Right now, I would send all of that down to the states. The problem is they\\'re only sending a small portion of it. They need to send more of that so that states can better take care of it.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis, your response on whether you would allow Iowa and the other 39 states who accepted Medicaid expansion to keep it.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I\\'ve spoken with a lot of folks here in Iowa, and we need health care that\\'s accessible, that\\'s affordable, and that\\'s accountable. And particularly an emphasis on mental health. In every corner of this state, everywhere I\\'ve traveled in the campaign, people are really concerned about mental health with the kids in schools, people that are coming out of service to our country, with veterans, we\\'re going to put a big emphasis on mental health.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve actually delivered on some of these things in Florida. We got accountability for the pharmacy benefit middlemen that are causing your drug prices to go up. So, we have transparency and consumers pay less. And I just beat the federal government to allow the state of Florida to buy prescription drugs from Canada, which is 25 cents on the dollar. What are prescription drugs cost? I want seniors to be able to do.</p>\\n<p>And then finally, we need to upend this COVID and medical authoritarian regime that we saw going around this country during COVID. It\\'s wrong to force vaxes like the COVID shot and say people are going to lose their jobs. That is not going to ever happen on my watch, trust me.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, same. Fifteen-second clarification.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think what you do is you block-grant the program and then let states run the way they see fit to do. But I can tell you this, expanding Medicaid leads to less private coverage. It doesn\\'t necessarily increase access to quality care. I want to actually get people good health care. It\\'s not just about a sheet of paper if you don\\'t get any good doctors that get you entitled for that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor DeSantis mentioned mental health. Let\\'s talk about that. There is a mental health crisis in this country. An estimated 58 million Americans suffer from some type of mental health illness. Governor Haley, you say the mental health crisis is a quote, \"cancer that no one has dealt with\". What do you think is causing the crisis and what would you do to fix it?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think we saw it exacerbated by COVID. I mean with the school lockdowns and everything else we see young people now with more anxiety, stress and depression than ever before. One in three people right now suffer from mental health issues, but if treated, they can live a perfectly normal life.</p>\\n<p>The problem is we don\\'t have enough mental health therapists. We don\\'t have enough mental health treatment centers. We don\\'t have enough addiction centers. And if you happen to be lucky enough to get one of those three, insurance doesn\\'t cover it.</p>\\n<p>We have got to start dealing with this, because it\\'s become a huge issue. And that\\'s why we need to have more Telehealth, so that people can get the mental health care they need right when they need it. We need to have mental health counselors in schools so they can identify when a child has a problem that they can get the help that they need. But right now, we\\'ve got to get access to care. And that\\'s, again, why I want to move those federal programs down to the state level, because states know they need more mental health support.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re not getting the dollars to do it. We don\\'t need D.C. bureaucrats handling that. We need this on the ground so that we can get the mental health centers, get the therapists, and get the help that people need so that they can be healthy again.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, you said right here in Iowa this summer that closing mental health institutions, a policy supported by Ronald Reagan, was a mistake. As President, would you restore federal funding to those mental health institutions?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yes, we need more people in institutionalized settings, unfortunately. But, you know, Governor Haley mentioned, I think, correctly, the devastating mental health consequences for these school closures, a lot of things that happened during COVID, I never recalled seeing her out there fighting the fight. I was on the front lines on that. Governor Kim Reynolds was on the front lines on that.</p>\\n<p>We fought back against the biomedical state. We were attacked by the media. We were attacked by the pharmaceutical companies. We were attacked by the left, attacked by Fauci. We stood and we helped people. And Iowa and Florida had the best schools opening in the entire pandemic because we led. That\\'s what you want to do.</p>\\n<p>Now, in terms of mental health, I\\'ve run into veterans here in Iowa, and I think we have a significant problem with veterans, particularly the post-9-11 veterans, and we know the stats on suicide. It\\'s really, really sad. And as a fellow veteran, as President, I have to put that issue on the front burner.</p>\\n<p>We can\\'t keep turning a blind eye to what\\'s happening to our vets. It\\'s not going to be done just through the VA. And it can\\'t be done just by pumping people with pharmaceuticals. If a veteran has post- traumatic stress, you need more than just that. So, we\\'re going to use the VA to link veterans with resources that are throughout our country.</p>\\n<p>For example, in Florida, we have an organization that trains service dogs to be able to be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. They understand the symptoms, they mitigate it, and you know what? The suicide rate is close to zero as a result of that. We got to think bigger than these bureaucracies, and we\\'ve got to be there for our vets and their mental health.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Turning -- turning to the topic of climate, 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded on Earth, and Americans are already feeling the impact. Just yesterday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the U.S. experienced 28 weather and climate-related disasters that cost at least $1 billion last year -- another record.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, here in Florida. I\\'m sorry, Governor DeSantis, here in Iowa, massive flooding has left farmers underwater. In Florida, rising seas threaten coastal cities. You have taken action in your home state to mitigate the problems of rising seas. But as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So, on day one as President, we take Biden\\'s Green New Deal. We tear it up and we throw it in the trash can. It is bad for this country. We have to have reliable energy. And here\\'s the thing, you know, they talk about -- Joe Biden has said that global warming is worse than a nuclear war. And I\\'m just thinking to myself, well, gee, John Kerry hasn\\'t given up his private jet. Obama hasn\\'t given up his Martha\\'s Vineyard seaside mansion. I haven\\'t seen Biden do anything to hold China accountable except making sure that Hunter gets his money.</p>\\n<p>So, these guys talk out of one side of their mouth and then they behave in another way. And I think that\\'s wrong. But I also think that those policies would devastate communities, particularly here in Iowa. I mean, for example, he wants to mandate electric vehicles. That\\'s going to be more costly.</p>\\n<p>I think the car companies would go bankrupt, but it\\'s going to hurt liquid fuels, which is very, very important. You\\'re going to end up having rolling blackouts if they kneecap reliable energy production in this country. Florida\\'s had a massive decline in emissions -- wasn\\'t because of a single mandate.</p>\\n<p>It was because of innovation, because a lot of natural gas has replaced coal. We do have market-based solar, and it\\'s a compliment, but we cannot walk away from reliable energy. And I think about, here\\'s what the left wants to do. They want to take away your freedom, and they want you to pay more for everything.</p>\\n<p>We need you to pay less for energy. And we need to make sure people can innovate. We cannot have these mandates and they\\'ll be gone the day I\\'m President.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, Governor, just a point of clarification -- 15 seconds. A recent research at the University of Iowa ties these floods in Iowa to the rise in greenhouse gases.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And here\\'s the thing, Jake, I appreciate that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Let me just ask the question. As President, would you do anything to deal with this underlying cause?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Innovate, and here\\'s the thing. China is building two coal plants a week. You can do everything Biden wants to do and you\\'re going to have way more of what China\\'s increasing it. So, why would we be cutting off our nose to spite our face? China is the problem here, and so hold them accountable.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But don\\'t hold the American people to less opportunity.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley, as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause of the floods and other climate disasters, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, first of all, regardless of what party, everybody wants to have clean air, clean water. They want a world that they can pass on to their kids that\\'s going to be healthy and all of that. But it\\'s how do we do that? I think the first thing we have to understand is you don\\'t deal in extremes.</p>\\n<p>When I was at the United Nations, the reason I took us out of the Paris climate agreement was because President Obama had put all these mandates down on our businesses, but they didn\\'t do anything to hold China and India to account. Those are the two countries we have to really go to if we care about the environment, that we go and make them be held accountable.</p>\\n<p>The second thing is we\\'ll roll back all of Biden\\'s green subsidies because they\\'re misplaced. Rather than putting anything towards innovation on what we can do on nuclear fusion and other things that reduce emissions, which there are things out there, to go and have everybody have to drive an electric car by 2035. That\\'s not even smart. One, because which, by the way, Ron took Biden\\'s stimulus money and did charging stations all throughout Florida. I wouldn\\'t have taken the stimulus money. But what that does is basically, we don\\'t have the infrastructure. And I\\'m not just talking about charging stations. Electric vehicles are heavy. Our roads and bridges wouldn\\'t be able to handle that if we did that because they\\'re heavy in weight.</p>\\n<p>And so we have to be smart about the way we do that. Not to mention 70 percent of the batteries in electric cars are made in China. So, Biden gave this massive windfall to our number one national security threat. If we\\'re going to do it, innovate it, transition and do it the right way, not in extremes.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. I want to turn to the issue of crime. The majority of Americans describe crime in the U.S. as either extremely or very serious. Recent data show crime rates falling, but some violent crime rates do remain high. Governor Haley, former President Trump, suggested that he might try to stop violent crime by deploying U.S. troops to democratic-run states and cities, something he could potentially do under the Insurrection Act. Is that something that you would do as President?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> What I would do is, first of all, defund sanctuary cities. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. That\\'s where we\\'re seeing a lot of crime. But the second thing is, our law enforcement is demoralized right now. Because if they go and they arrest someone for having a stolen gun, it\\'s demoralizing when they go through all that effort, put their lives at risk, and then you turn around and let that criminal go the very next day.</p>\\n<p>Prosecutors need to prosecute according to the law and we\\'ve got to start holding them accountable. When we bring law and order back to our cities, then that\\'s when they\\'ll be safe. You don\\'t do it by defunding the police, and you don\\'t do it by just praising the police.</p>\\n<p>You do it by having their backs, making sure we pass the first Body Camera Bill in the country in South Carolina, to make sure that law enforcement felt like they could do their job without anyone -- without feeling threatened about them doing their job.</p>\\n<p>But we have to have prosecutors prosecuting. We have to defund sanctuary cities. We have to get these stolen guns and drugs off the street. And the only way we can do that is when we empower law enforcement.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I just think, I mean, that quote from the President, former president Trump is a little bit rich because he was President during the worst rioting in the modern history of this country, the BLM riots in the summer of 2020. When I saw that happening in Minneapolis, in Florida, I called out the National Guard. We had state law enforcement deployed.</p>\\n<p>We said, you\\'re not burning down our cities in this state. And you know what? It didn\\'t happen. He sat in the White House and tweeted law and order, but he did nothing to ensure law and order. As your President, I will never let our cities burn. You have every right to stop this runaway rioting as President. In fact, you have a duty.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley and I have a disagreement on the BLM stuff, too, because she tweeted during this period of time that the death of George Floyd should be, quote, \"personal and painful for each and every American\".</p>\\n<p>But people in Iowa had nothing to do with that, or Florida or South Carolina, she was virtue signaling to the left, she was accepting the narrative, and she was trying to impress people who were never going to like us.</p>\\n<p>I never bought in to going after the police, we backed the Blue to the state of Florida, and we\\'re about lower crime as a result of that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s interesting that he did that. He put a tweet that was very similar.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That\\'s not true.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> But let me tell you why I did that. First of all, we had one of the worst racial shootings. We had the shooting of Walter Scott who was shot seven times in the back by a dirty cop. We had a horrific shooting at a church where a white supremacist came in and killed nine amazing souls.</p>\\n<p>BLM, all of that, we never had to deal with riots. We never had to call in the National Guard, Ron, because when we had both of those shootings, we were able to pull people together. We didn\\'t have riots, we had vigils. We didn\\'t have protests, we had prayer. We brought people together.</p>\\n<p>When I said that about George Floyd, when we turned around and had the worst shooting in a religious place that we had seen in this country, not only did I pass the first Body Camera Bill in the country and keep our state together, not only did I move to bring the Confederate flag down, we came together as a state in prayer --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- and we had no division, no riots, no anything.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> We didn\\'t need the National Guard because a leader knows how to bring out the best of the people.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. So, you have been sparring on the campaign trail for months. We\\'ve seen some vicious attack ads going back and forth, and tonight we have had a very lively debate. On a different note, Governor DeSantis, let me ask you, what do you admire about Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, look, I mean, I think that, you know, at the United Nations, I did think that she spoke out strongly on some key issues, and I appreciated that. I also appreciate the state of South Carolina. My wife is a College of Charleston graduate. Her parents lived there for many, many years.</p>\\n<p>And so, it is a wonderful state. There\\'s a lot of great people there. And I think to be able to have been Governor there is a great achievement. And I really appreciate everyone I\\'ve gotten to meet in South Carolina.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, what do you admire about Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think he\\'s been a good governor.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Okay. So, we\\'re going to squeeze in another quick break. And we\\'ll be right back with more from the Republican debates here at Drake University.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re back live from Des Moines, Iowa in the CNN Republican Presidential Debate. We now have time for closing statements and we begin with Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, I want to thank the good people of Iowa. I have campaigned for 11 months, whether it\\'s driving a combine or holding a pig at a produce area or whether it\\'s the fact that we\\'ve met owners of bakeries and small businesses.</p>\\n<p>You know, every one of them knows that we can\\'t go through four more years of chaos. And if it\\'s Donald Trump, there will be four more years of chaos. And we can\\'t be a country in disarray in a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. And we can\\'t go through another nail-biter of an election.</p>\\n<p>And if you look at the polls right now, going against Joe Biden, in every one of those head-to-head polls, Ron doesn\\'t beat Joe Biden. Trump is head-to-head. On a good day, he might be up by two points. I defeat Biden by 17 points. That\\'s bigger than the presidency.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s House, that\\'s Senate, that\\'s governorships, that\\'s down to school board. That\\'s a mandate to get our spending under control and get inflation down. That\\'s a mandate to get our kids reading again and go back to the basics in education. That\\'s a mandate to secure our borders with no more excuses. That\\'s a mandate to bring law and order back to our country and that\\'s a mandate for a strong America that we can be proud of.</p>\\n<p>We can do this. I know we can do this. If you will join with me in this movement, if you join with me in this fight, I promise you our best days are to come. God bless you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, it\\'s been great to visit all 99 counties here in Iowa. I\\'ve been able to meet so many friends and really learn about some of the best of America. Iowa\\'s votes do not need to be corrected by any other state. You all know what you\\'re doing. And we have an opportunity on Monday to really change the course of history.</p>\\n<p>Donald Trump\\'s running for his issues. Nikki Haley\\'s running for her donors\\' issues. I\\'m running for your issues, your family\\'s issues, and solely to turn this country around. I\\'m the only one running that\\'s delivered on 100 percent of my promises. And I\\'m the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again, from the teachers\\' unions, to Fauci, to the Democratic Party.</p>\\n<p>We need to run under the banner of bold colors that are putting the American people first. We can\\'t run under a banner of pale pastels of the warmed-over corporatism, the likes of which is practiced by Nikki Haley. Freedom is on the ballot. Decline is a choice. We have it within our power to fix this country and to turn it around.</p>\\n<p>I am asking for your support in the Iowa caucus on Monday, January 15th. I\\'ll be a President that you can be proud of and I promise you this, I will get the job done and I will not let you down. Thank you and God bless you all.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Our thanks to Governor DeSantis and Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis and Governor Haley, thank you so much both of you for being here tonight. Thanks to our audience, to our host, Drake University. For Dana Bash and the whole CNN team, I\\'m Jake Tapper. Thank you so much for watching. Be sure to join us Monday, January 15th at 4 P.M. Eastern for CNN\\'s coverage of the Iowa caucuses. Anderson Cooper and Kaitlan Collins are going to pick it up right now with more on the debate.

(CNN); and<br />Jake Tapper (CNN)</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, this is the CNN Republican presidential debate.</p>\\n<p>We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world watching us on CNN, CNN Max, CNN International, CNN en Espanol, and CNN.com.</p>\\n<p>Good evening. I\\'m Jake Tapper, moderating tonight\\'s debate alongside my friend and colleague Dana Bash.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> And just five days from now, voters here in Iowa will cast the first votes of the 2024 presidential race.</p>\\n<p>Tonight, the very first one-on-one matchup between top contenders Governor Ron DeSantis and former Governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Former President Trump met the requirements for tonight\\'s debate, but declined to participate.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Our commitment in this debate is to provide as much information as possible to voters, especially here in Iowa, before the first contests begin next week.</p>\\n<p>So, in choosing topics, we focused on the issues important to Republicans.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s bring out the candidates now.</p>\\n<p>Please welcome Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Please welcome former South Carolina Governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Candidates, please take your positions behind the podiums while we remind you and our audience of the ground rules.</p>\\n<p>Each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions, 60 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Timing lights will remind you when time is expiring.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> We also remind our audience here in the Sheslow Auditorium at Drake University to be respectful, so the candidates can hear the questions and can hear each other.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Just hours ago, the Republican field narrowed once again. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ended his bid for the presidency.</p>\\n<p>So, with one fewer candidate in the running, let\\'s start with the decision voters here in Iowa are about to face.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, why should voters who are looking for an alternative to the current front-runner, former President Trump, vote for you, rather than former Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, to people of Iowa, good evening. It\\'s great to be in Iowa to have a debate here.</p>\\n<p>Donald Trump\\'s running to pursue his issues. Nikki Haley\\'s running to pursue her donors\\' issues. I\\'m running to pursue your issues and your family\\'s issues and to turn this country around. I\\'m the only one running that\\'s delivered on 100 percent of the promises that I have made.</p>\\n<p>We have delivered huge victories in the state of Florida, things that Republicans have been asking for, for a generation. I\\'m also the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again. We beat the teachers union on universal school choice. We beat Soros on crime. We beat Fauci on COVID. We beat the Dems on election integrity. And I beat the left by banning China from buying land in the state of Florida.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley is running. We don\\'t need another mealymouthed politician who just tells you what she thinks you want to hear just to try to get your vote, then to get in office and to do her donors\\' bidding.</p>\\n<p>She was in another state, and she said the people of Iowa\\'s votes need to be corrected. This is somebody that wrote in her book that Hillary Clinton inspired her to first run for office.</p>\\n<p>I remember Hillary denigrating people on the Republican side as deplorables. We don\\'t need a candidate who\\'s going to look down on Middle America. We have had enough of that. I\\'m the only one that\\'s going to be able to lead this country\\'s revival.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m asking for your support, and I won\\'t let you down.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, a response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think this is a time that we know that we need a new generational leader.</p>\\n<p>We have watched our country be in disarray. We see the world on fire, and we need someone who\\'s had executive experience. I have been a two- term governor that took a double-digit unemployment state and turned it into an economic powerhouse. I was at the U.N. I dealt with Russia, China, Iran every day.</p>\\n<p>But, you\\'re going to find out tonight that there is going to be a lot of Ron\\'s lies that has happened. There are at least a couple of dozen so far that he has done. So, what we\\'re going to do is rather than have him go and tell you all these lies, you can go to DeSantislies.com and look at all of those. There is at least two dozen lies that he has told about me, and you can see where a fact checker say exactly what\\'s going to happen and exactly why it\\'s wrong.</p>\\n<p>So, it will cover the fact that he is only mad about the donors because the donors used to be with him, but they\\'re no longer with him now. And that\\'s because he is upset about the fact that his campaign is exploding. You\\'re going to see the fact that he has switched his policies multiple times, and we\\'ll call that out tonight. But, every time he lies, Drake University, don\\'t turn this into a drinking game, because you will be overserved by the end of the night.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I think this is interesting, because you can actually go to RonDesantis.com, because Nikki Haley has this tactic. If you hold her accountable to her record, first she\\'ll say, I never said that. Well, one good rule of thumb, if she says she has never said something, that definitely means she said it, and then she\\'ll say you\\'re lying, you\\'re lying. That means not only did she say it but she is on videotape saying it. And so, we have all the greatest hits. The reality is Nikki Haley is not somebody that has been willing to stand in and fight on behalf of conservatives.</p>\\n<p>You know, she ran for governor saying she was going to do universal school choice, and she caved to the teachers union. She didn\\'t deliver that. In Florida, I delivered the largest expansion of school choice in the history of the United States. I beat the teachers union, and you know what the results are? When she was governor of South Carolina, she was rated 50th in education, dead last. You know, where Florida is under my watch, number one in the nation.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Your response, Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Go to DeSantislies.com and you can find out for yourself. But, why don\\'t we talk about the fact that if we\\'re going to say this, when Ron was representing Florida, he said that he promised not to raise the debt limit when he got to D.C. Yet, he raised the debt limit by hundreds of billions of dollars. He used to support Ukraine. He supported Ukraine when President Obama was in office. Now, he is trying to copy Trump and saying that he no longer supports Ukraine, and doesn\\'t want to give them foreign aid anymore. He also goes and says that he wants to talk about me insulting Iowans. Iowans know when you\\'re telling a joke.</p>\\n<p>The fact that he is only running in one state is not the way you win President. I\\'m running it all states. But, he should tell Iowans why he authored legislation to ban the renewable fuel standard that\\'s so important to Iowans\\' economy, and the fact that he co-sponsored five different pieces of legislation to get rid of it. And also, then he also said he would never do anything with Social Security. Yet, he voted three times to raise the retirement age of Social Security.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, if you\\'re going to talk about what you said --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- and you did, I think you\\'ve got your own explaining to do --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Well, we\\'re going to --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- rather than telling lies about --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> -- well, thank you, Governor. We\\'re going to get to a lot of these issues in the debate. Governor Haley, when Governor Christie dropped out of the race just a few hours ago, he said the most important issue is \"the character of the candidate\". Governor Christie also said he ran because he knew he would be the only Republican candidate to speak the truth about former President Donald Trump. Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be President again?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think the next President needs to have moral clarity. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that it\\'s taxpayer money, not your own money. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that when you\\'re dealing with dictators in the world, that we always have to fight for democracies and human rights and protecting Americans and preventing war.</p>\\n<p>And so, when you look at Donald Trump, I have said, I think he was the right President at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies, but his way is not my way. I don\\'t have vengeance. I don\\'t have vendettas. I don\\'t take things personally. For me, it\\'s very much about no drama, no whining and getting results and getting them done. So, I don\\'t think that President Trump is the right President to go forward. I think it\\'s time for a new generational leader that\\'s going to go and make America proud again. That\\'s what I\\'m going to try and do.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, what is your response to Chris Christie? Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be President again?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I\\'m running because I\\'m the guy that\\'s going to be able to engineer a comeback for this country. I appreciated what President Trump did. But, let\\'s just be honest. He said he was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to drain the swamp. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to hold Hillary accountable and he let her off the hook. He said he was going to eliminate the debt and he added $7.8 trillion to the debt. So, we need to deliver and get this stuff done.</p>\\n<p>And I think the difference between Nikki Haley and me, and I listened to all that litany of stuff, I debated the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom. I thought he lied a lot. Man, Nikki Haley made -- gives him a run for his money and she may even be more liberal than Gavin Newsom is. We are in a situation here in Florida.</p>\\n<p>And as Republicans, you need somebody that is going to be in there and fight for you. And Nikki Haley, any time the going gets tough, any time people come down, she caves. When you need someone standing and fight for you, don\\'t look for Nikki Haley. You won\\'t be able to find her if you had a search warrant. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Look, I think I dealt with Russia, China, Iran, North Korea every day. No one ever said I caved. I defended America and I fought for America. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>But I\\'ll also say this. This is not a time where you have to have pettiness. I wish Donald Trump was up here on this stage. He\\'s the one that I\\'m running against. He\\'s the one that I wish would be here. He needs to be defending his record. Right now he\\'s not defending the fact that he allowed us to have $8 trillion in debt over four years that our kids are never going to forgive us for. The fact that he didn\\'t deal with China when it came to stealing intellectual property. The fact that they gave us COVID. The fact that they have gone and continued to put up Chinese police stations and continue to threaten our military.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\'t do enough to make sure that we were really standing with our friends and doing some other things. What we need is a leader that\\'s not looking at four years and eight years. We need a president that\\'s looking at 20 and 30 years. Because I want my kids to have a good future. I want them to have one without debt, one where they can read, one with secure borders, one where we have law and order, and one where America is strong.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, with all due respect, you know, for her to single out Donald Trump on China, and, look, I think he could have been tougher on them, 100 percent. When Nikki Haley was governor of South Carolina, she was the number one governor in America for Republicans of bringing China into her state. She wrote a love letter to the ambassador saying that they were a great friend. She is on video saying China is a friend. She had a business, five -- Chinese business five miles from a military base. There is video of her on the website right in front of a Chinese flag saying that she works for them now.</p>\\n<p>So that was her number one achievement as governor was bringing China into the state of South Carolina. So you say you\\'re going to look 10, 20, 30 years down the road? Why wasn\\'t she doing that then when people were raising the red flags about it?</p>\\n<p>In Florida, I banned China from buying land in our state.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Yes, but, Governor DeSantis...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And we kicked them out of our universities. That\\'s what you need to be doing. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re going to talk about China in a little bit. I want to talk about the economy, which according to a recent Des Moines Register poll shows that the economy is the top issue for caucus-goers here.</p>\\n<p>So, Governor Haley, the rate of inflation is down. Prices, though, are still high, and Americans are struggling to afford food, cars, and housing. What is the single most important policy that you would implement as president to make the essentials in Americans\\' lives more important?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think we have to acknowledge that Republicans and Democrats have both done this. I mean, the fact that they\\'ve done all of this wasteful spending, they did a $2.2 trillion COVID stimulus bill that expanded welfare that\\'s now left us with 80 million Americans on Medicaid, 42 million Americans on food stamps. That\\'s a third of our country.</p>\\n<p>What I will do is I think it\\'s time we have an accountant in the White House. We have to have someone that respects taxpayer dollars. And we\\'ll start by clawing back $100 billion of unspent COVID dollars that are still out there.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ll go and instead of 87,000 IRS agents going after middle America, we\\'ll go after the hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID fraud, 1 out of every $7. If 8 percent of our budget is interest, quit borrowing. Cut up the credit cards.</p>\\n<p>I had to balance a budget as governor. You have to balance a budget every day. Why is Congress the only group that refuses to balance a budget? We\\'ll stop the spending. We\\'ll stop the borrowing. We\\'ll eliminate the pet projects and the earmarks. And I\\'ll veto any spending bill that doesn\\'t take us back to pre-COVID levels.</p>\\n<p>And then we want to make sure that we allow the middle class to breathe. We\\'re going to eliminate the federal gas and diesel tax in this country and cut taxes on the middle class and simplify those brackets. And then we want to make the small business tax cuts permanent. They made corporate tax cuts permanent, but they made small business tax cuts temporary. Small businesses are the heartbeat of America. We need to prove it by making those tax cuts permanent. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, what\\'s your response? How would you make those essentials more affordable for Americans?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I disagree with Ambassador Haley. We don\\'t need an accountant in the White House, we need a leader in the White House. And that\\'s what I would bring. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve spoken with Iowans, visiting all 99 counties, and also folks all across this country. The American dream is slipping away. People are working hard. They\\'re getting the most out of their God- given ability. They\\'re doing everything right. And they\\'re falling further and further behind.</p>\\n<p>Trying to afford a new home today, your monthly mortgage payment would probably be twice as much as what it would have been if you were starting out five years ago. We have to make the economy work their those folks.</p>\\n<p>Yes, I\\'m going to battle the spending. In Florida, you look and we have the national debt clock going up to $34 trillion. I see it. If you did a debt clock for the state of Florida, it would be counting down.</p>\\n<p>Because we\\'ve paid down 25 percent of our state debt just since I\\'ve been governor. We\\'re going to open up all energy for production because that will be deflationary.</p>\\n<p>You know, Nikki Haley when she was governor, she promised she would never do the gas tax. Then she tried to raise the gas tax on hardworking South Carolinians. Here\\'s the thing. We need to fly a flag of bold colors carrying the banner of putting the American people first, not the pale pastel of the warmed over corporatism of people like Nikki Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, I want to bring you in, but because Governor DeSantis mentioned the gas tax, you do want to eliminate the federal gas tax. And that tax generated approximately $40 billion in 2022 and helps pay for road construction and repair.</p>\\n<p>So how would you fix America\\'s roads and bridges if you take that money away?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, bless his heart. Desantislies.com. We have never raised a tax.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You try to.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> We\\'ve never raised a tax at all.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You tried. You\\'re on video.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I can tell you right --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So I can tell you that we killed the gas tax multiple times.</p>\\n<p>But what we said is if you want to raise the gas tax, you have to reduce the income tax by five times that amount. They didn\\'t want to do it. We\\'ve killed taxes every step of the way.</p>\\n<p>But if he\\'s going to talk about his economy, I think what we should say is why does Florida have the highest property insurance in the country? Why is it that it is named the American hotspot for inflation? Why is it that his state is now known to have the highest cost of living increases? And why is it that they\\'re saying senior citizens can no longer afford to live in Florida? So that\\'s the first thing I\\'ll say. We don\\'t need him doing that to our country.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to the gas tax, when we eliminate that federal tax, the money is collected in the states and they send it to the feds. The feds attach a lot of strings to it and send it back. 75 percent comes from the state, 25 percent comes from the federal government.</p>\\n<p>What they do when they add those strings is they pay for a lot of things that aren\\'t roads, green spaces, sidewalks, all of those things, but they attach strings. I want that money to stay in the states. I want the states to be able to decide how to spend it. I don\\'t want Washington bureaucrats deciding what we need for scenery and green space and all those other things. I want every state, including the state of Iowa, to make the decisions on how they spend their road spending instead of the federal government.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She kind of admitted that she did try to raise the gas tax, and she\\'s on video saying this. I know she\\'ll say she never said. But she did.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You snippet that.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She did -- she did do it.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You took a little piece of that. That is not true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She also -- she also raise tax --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You are lying again.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She was in South Carolina, that\\'s on the record. And she even proposed a tax on groceries at one point. But I\\'m just thinking, have you seen your grocery bill lately? That\\'s one of the things that\\'s hitting working people the most, that groceries are going up probably twice as much what you do.</p>\\n<p>But I also think it\\'s important that we lift people up. So in Florida, we eliminated all sales tax on every baby item, diapers, wipes, strollers, cribs. We want families to be able to prosper in this country. One of the things that\\'s causing so much problem is the breakdown in the American family. We\\'ve done a lot in Florida to be able to rejuvenate that. But we need to make it easier for people to raise children in this country so that we can have strong families in a strong country.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, at a CNN town hall last week, you said you support a flat tax, which is a single income tax rate for every American. Under your plan, would working families pay the same tax rate as billionaires?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I would only do it if people are better off than they are now. I mean, I want people paying less taxes. Actually, if you think the last year we have numbers for the federal government took in the highest percentage of taxes from the economy since World War II, and yet they\\'re going deep into debt.</p>\\n<p>We have a spending problem in this country. It\\'s not a tax problem in this country. And if you had something that was simple and transparent, not only would that better for economic growth, it\\'s also better to end the weaponization of government.</p>\\n<p>The IRS has been weaponized against conservatives going back to the Obama administration. I was there for that. No one\\'s been held accountable for doing that.</p>\\n<p>You look at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the weaponization of federal power ends the day I become the president of the United States. There\\'s going to be a new sheriff in town. We\\'re going to restore the constitutional accountability that our founding fathers envision when they formatted the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>And you know, I\\'ve talked to folks who have overbearing federal agencies. I mean, you have farmers who have the EPA coming on their farmland because there\\'s maybe a puddle there, waters of the United States. Give me a break.</p>\\n<p>So we\\'re going to reduce the size of government, but we\\'re also going to reduce the scope of government.</p>\\n<p>And in Florida, I\\'ve actually delivered on this, Florida has the lowest percentage of state government workers per capita in the country, and the cost of our state government employees is the lowest in the country.</p>\\n<p>No wonder why we\\'re paying down debt while we\\'re cutting taxes for people. That\\'s the way to do it. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, 15-second point of clarification. The question was whether or not working families would pay the same amount...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They would pay...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> ... as billionaires?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They would pay less than what they\\'re paying now. The way I view it is, OK -- and you\\'d exempt people -- so you would pay no tax for -- for working-class people. It would only be as you get above. Because I think the first $40,000, $50,000 grand, that\\'s just to subsist. And even some places, you can\\'t even do that.</p>\\n<p>So you would have no tax up to a certain point, and then it would just be a single rate. So if somebody...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... makes $100,000, they pay a certain amount. If someone makes $200,000, they pay...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They make twice as much, and they pay twice as much.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, first of all, you just can\\'t trust what he says. I mean, that\\'s the biggest thing. We don\\'t have a grocery tax in South Carolina. And I never once raised taxes, period.</p>\\n<p>But what I will tell you is, it is to call into question, why did he promise he\\'d never raise the debt limit and he turned around and he raised it?</p>\\n<p>And then you want to go, and you see one side of what he says early on, and then he changes it. So here he goes and he says that he is all for energy independence. He wants to get the EPA out of the way. Well, why did he run on the fact that he wanted to ban fracking and ban offshore drilling?</p>\\n<p>Why did he go and author that legislation to eliminate the renewable fuel standard that so -- that matters so much?</p>\\n<p>And why now is he suddenly coming to Iowa and saying, \"Oh, never mind, I don\\'t mean all of that?\"</p>\\n<p>Why did he call Trump and say that he wanted him to stop drilling nine miles into federal waters? Why is he now saying this?</p>\\n<p>Why do you come to the people of Iowa and say one thing when you campaigned and, on day two of your office, you banned fracking; you banned offshore drilling,; you turned around and authored and led the charge on banning the renewable fuel standards...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yeah...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You\\'ve got to stand up for those things that you did.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You\\'ve been -- you\\'ve been beating that dead horse -- that\\'s been the...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Because it\\'s true, Ron. It\\'s true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We\\'re looking forward to be able to open up energy production, and definitely here in the Midwest, with biofuels. I\\'m the only one that checked all the boxes from the Iowa renewable fuel standard, because I\\'ve actually visited all 99 counties. I\\'ve actually shown up to people\\'s farms. I\\'ve sat and I\\'ve listened to people about what they\\'re going through, how their economy is structured and how it\\'s important that we\\'re producing energy here in the United States.</p>\\n<p>I never want to go hat in hand, like Biden has done, to Venezuela or Saudi and begging for energy. We\\'re going to be able to open up production. We\\'re going to choose Midland over Moscow. We\\'re going to choose the Marcellus Shale over the mullahs. And we\\'re going to choose the Bakken over Beijing.</p>\\n<p>Energy independence isn\\'t even -- it\\'s not -- it\\'s good for consumers. It\\'s good to reduce inflation. And it\\'s one of the best things we can do for our national security. So we\\'ll do that on day one, and we are going to reverse Biden\\'s green new deal and the electric vehicle mandates. We\\'ll save the American automobile.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>This has been one of the biggest years for illegal border crossings into the United States. Last month alone, 225,000 migrants illegally crossed the southern border. It\\'s a record high, overwhelming the Border Patrol resources that are already stretched thin. Mayors across the country say their cities are being pushed to a breaking point.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, former President Trump famously promised to build a wall on the southern border. He obviously did not get that done. You have promised to finish the job. How will you succeed where he failed?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We will build a wall. We will actually have Mexico pay for it, in the way that I thought Donald Trump was. We\\'re going to charge fees on remittances that workers send to foreign countries, billions of dollars. We\\'ll build the wall.</p>\\n<p>He also promised record deportations. Donald Trump deported fewer people than Barack Obama did when he was president. Biden\\'s let in 8 million people just in four years. They all have to go back. We have to enforce the rule of law in this country.</p>\\n<p>Think about what\\'s happening to our country. Just this week, we saw the news that a high -- that a school in Brooklyn, New York, had the kids stay home. They were not able to go to school, told you can\\'t go get an in-person education. Why? Because their -- the city\\'s commandeering the school to house illegal aliens in it.</p>\\n<p>Talk about putting Americans last. You\\'re putting these kids out of an education because you can\\'t control the border?</p>\\n<p>Biden has failed in this endeavor. He has not taken care that the laws of this country be faithfully executed.</p>\\n<p>Do not trust Nikki Haley with illegal immigration. That\\'s like having the fox guard the hen house. She\\'s on tape at the Aspen Institute -- she\\'ll say she didn\\'t say it -- she was chastising conservatives, saying it\\'s disrespectful to illegal aliens to say that they\\'re criminals.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re violating the law. It\\'s disrespectful when people come to this country illegally and impose burdens on our communities and run drugs into this country. That\\'s what\\'s disrespectful.</p>\\n<p>She\\'s weak on immigration. She\\'s bankrolled by people who want open borders. And she said there shouldn\\'t be a limit on immigration; you should work with corporate CEOS...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thanks, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That is pale pastels. That is warmed-over...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you so much.</p>\\n<p>So, Governor Haley...[<i>cheering and applause</i>]... Governor DeSantis and also Donald Trump are attacking you for that comment in 2015 in which you said undocumented immigrants should not be called -- quote -- \"criminals.\"</p>\\n<p>At the time, the full context is you said -- quote -- \"We don\\'t need to talk about them as criminals. They\\'re not. They\\'re families that want a better life, and they\\'re desperate to get here\" -- unquote.</p>\\n<p>Do you still feel that way?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I saw them. When I was at the United Nations, I saw them. That doesn\\'t mean we should let them into our country.</p>\\n<p>I mean, first of all, I will tell you that, when I was governor of South Carolina, we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country. Obama sued us over it, and we won. We fought Obama on illegal immigration. We fought Obama on migrant kids. We fought Obama on Syrian refugees. We fought Obama on Guantanamo Bay prisoners.</p>\\n<p>I have always said we are a country of laws. The second we stop being a country of laws, we give up everything this country was founded on.</p>\\n<p>But I will tell you, in passing that toughest illegal immigration law in the country, we passed E-Verify, which I want to take national, which is where businesses have to prove that the people they hire are in this country legally. I passed it within six months of being governor. Ron didn\\'t pass it for five years.</p>\\n<p>He only waited to pass it when he decided to run for president. What we need to do is not just ban a wall. We need to put 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. We need to defund sanctuary cities once and for all, no more safe havens for illegal immigrants.</p>\\n<p>We need to make sure we go back to the remain-in-Mexico policy, so that no one even steps foot on U.S. soil. And instead of catch-and- release, we need to go to catch-and-deport. That\\'s the only way we will stop the incentives of these illegal immigrants coming across.</p>\\n<p>Biden turned around and gave half-a-million Venezuelans temporary protective status. That\\'s half-a-million driver\\'s licenses, half-a- million Social Security numbers. All that does is incentivize them to pick up the phone...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... call their family members, and tell them to come on ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She did bring...[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>When she was governor, she did bring Syrian refugees, and she got criticized for that.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> That is not true.

In fact, you have got them from China, Iran, Russia, the Middle East. When I was down there a couple years ago, because I have sent people down there, you had people from Libya and Haiti.</p>\\n<p>This is a ticking time bomb for this country. There are, of course, going to be terrorist cells that have come in. It\\'s like the lowest- cost way to be able to harm this country. Just send people across the southern border.</p>\\n<p>Nikki Haley also opposed the border wall in 2016. She said that -- she ridiculed it when Donald Trump was for that. I\\'m telling you, you need a wall. You can\\'t trust politicians to do this. If the wall\\'s there, it\\'s a physical fact of life. And it\\'s a huge step to restoring this country\\'s sovereignty.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis. Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Go to DeSantislies.com. I said, you can\\'t just build a wall. You have to do more than build a wall. It was having the wall and everything else. You can\\'t trust what Ron is saying.</p>\\n<p>But this is a bigger issue. This is more than him just constantly being desperate and throwing things on me. This is the fact that we have to realize my parents came here legally. They came the right way 50 years ago. They put in the time. They put in the price. They are offended by what\\'s happening on the border.</p>\\n<p>And my mom would always say, if they don\\'t follow the laws to come into this country, they won\\'t follow the laws when they are in this country. And we have to start treating this like it is. This is putting harm on our schools, on our hospitals. Taxpayers are paying for it. You see these mayors are now upset about it.</p>\\n<p>The only reason Eric Adams is now upset, why? He shouldn\\'t be a sanctuary city then. That\\'s why we have to defund sanctuary cities. Now Governor Abbott finally did to them what\\'s been happening to Texas for so long. We have got to put an end to this. It\\'s dangerous, and it doesn\\'t even count the fentanyl that\\'s happening.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you. Thank you, Governor. Thank you. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, there are more than 10 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States, according to Pew Research.</p>\\n<p>Will any of them be allowed to stay in the United States under your administration?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The number of people that will be amnestied when I\\'m president is zero.</p>\\n<p>We cannot do an amnesty in this country. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>First of all, all it\\'s going to do is cause more people to want to come illegally. So you have got to enforce the law. It\\'s got to be consistent. People got to know it\\'s there.</p>\\n<p>You also have to remove benefits for people who are here illegally. California, you can go, illegal alien, and you get free health insurance coverage. You\\'re here illegally, and they\\'re doing that? We should not let states provide these benefits.</p>\\n<p>In Florida, obviously, we don\\'t do that. We don\\'t allow the driver\\'s license and all that. But some states do. And it creates a magnet for people coming in. So, federally, no benefits, no enticements to come in, and then the states, we\\'re going to crack down on sanctuary states and sanctuary cities.</p>\\n<p>And I showed the hypocrisy of all this back in 2022 because we have a program to transport illegal aliens to sanctuary jurisdictions. And one of the places we sent 52, beautiful, liberal Martha\\'s Vineyard.</p>\\n<p>And you know what? These are folks that were on their high horse, saying how they were sanctuary jurisdiction, saying nobody is illegal. All refugees are welcome. That\\'s what they had in their town. The minute even 50 came up, they called the state of emergency and deported them off the island the next day. How do you think Texas feels? How do you think all these other communities feel that are overwhelming -- being overwhelmed?</p>\\n<p>So, we cannot have liberal elites in this country imposing policies on the rest of us that they are not willing to deal with the consequences of them.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, by the -- when you\\'re President, will any of the more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. be allowed to stay in the country under your administration?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You have to deport them. And the reason you have to deport them is they\\'re cutting the line. You\\'ve got people who have done this and tried to go through the right way. You can\\'t have them go and jump the line, and suddenly do that. And that is actually what will get them to stop coming, is when they do realize they get to the wall and they have to turn around and go back. It\\'s a dangerous process of what happens for them to try and migrate here.</p>\\n<p>But, when I was at the United Nations, and we had this, which is another reason why we need to have Trump here defending himself and talking about what he would do going in the future, because it\\'s a problem. I was on the ground in Honduras and Guatemala. And what we saw as a lot of the reason why they were coming from there is because of gangs and drugs. And so, what we did was we had our military go and train them on how to deal with gangs. We went and put drug boats on the water to keep the drugs from coming. But, we said you have to have them processed from here. You can\\'t have them come. We were able to stop that flow. We\\'ve got to go back to do that. But, we need to end it once and for all. Donald Trump didn\\'t do that. That\\'s why he needs to be here debating on the stage right now.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor, thank you. Let\\'s turn to foreign policy. You have expressed different visions for how the U.S. should approach the international complex. And I want to start with Ukraine. It\\'s been nearly two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and there is still no end in sight to that war. Governor Haley, you say that this is a \"war about freedom that Ukraine must win.\" Governor DeSantis says, \"We need to bring this war to an end.\" Do you believe he shares your commitment to a Ukrainian victory?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Nobody knows what he believes, because when President Obama was in office, he supported foreign aid to Ukraine. Now, he is copying Trump and trying to act like he doesn\\'t want to support Ukraine. But, let me tell you why Ukraine should matter. First of all, I don\\'t think we should give cash to any country, friend or foe, because you can\\'t follow it. You can\\'t hold it accountable. I don\\'t think we need to put troops on the ground. And Ukrainians want to win this themselves.</p>\\n<p>But, dictators always say, always do what they say they\\'re going to do. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. They did. Russia said they were going to invade Ukraine. They -- we watched it. China says Taiwan is next. We better believe them. Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. Those are NATO countries, and that puts America at war. This is about preventing war. It\\'s always been about preventing war.</p>\\n<p>If we support Ukraine, that\\'s only 3.5 percent of our defense budget. Biden and no one else is telling the American people the truth about that. The Europeans have put in more than that, and they should. It\\'s their neighborhood. But, this is a pro-American freedom-loving country. And we better remember that you have to be a friend to get a friend. And we needed a lot of friends, September 12. We\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re having the backs of the right friends, because if Russia wins, China wins. There is a reason the Taiwanese want us to help the Ukrainians. And that\\'s because they know if Ukraine wins, China won\\'t invade Taiwan. This is about preventing war.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I supported Trump\\'s policy vis-a-vis Russia, Ukraine, and it was successful. You know, the Biden policy has not been. But, Nikki Haley is basically a carbon copy of what Biden is. It\\'s an open-ended commitment. They want another $108 billion. They will not tell you when the -- they have achieved their goal. And this is going to go on maybe hundreds of billions more into the future. I think a lot of people have died. We need to find a way to end this, because our priorities for national security, of course, the border, which we talked about, and people like Nikki Haley care more about Ukraine\\'s border than she does about our own southern border, which is wrong.</p>\\n<p>But, we also have to look at what\\'s the top threat to this country. It\\'s the Chinese Communist Party. We are not doing what we need to do to have adequate hard power in the Indo-Pacific. And here is the thing. We don\\'t have enough resources, being $35 trillion in debt, to continue doing hundreds of billions of dollars. We got to focus on our issues here at home.</p>\\n<p>And we\\'ve got to deal with the top threat that we face, which is China.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> And then I wonder why you raised the debt when you were in Congress, because we\\'re all paying for that.</p>\\n<p>What I will tell you is, this is the lie they\\'re telling the American people over and over again. It is so wrong to say this. They\\'re saying you have to choose between Ukraine or Israel, or Israel and -- and securing the border. Supporting Ukraine is 3.5 percent of our budget. I don\\'t want cash going. It\\'s equipment and it\\'s ammunition. If we support Ukraine and Israel, that\\'s only 5 percent of our defense budget. If we support...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So you\\'re going to borrow that?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> If we support Ukraine, Israel, and secure the border, that\\'s less than 20 percent of Biden\\'s green subsidies. You do not have to choose when it comes to national security. This is about keeping Americans safe. This is about preventing war. This is about keeping our military men and women from having to fight a war. And you only do that when you focus on national security, not telling lies to the American people that they have to choose. That is wrong. That\\'s never been the case. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Here is the problem with what she\\'s saying. She -- she doesn\\'t articulate how this comes to an end, except she was asked after the last debate by, I believe, Megyn Kelly, and she said, you bring to it an end by bringing Ukraine into NATO. But, of course, we\\'re a NATO country. So if you bring Ukraine into NATO, that puts the United States at war. Megyn said that to her, and then she basically gave a word salad as to how you go from there.</p>\\n<p>So they have sent cash. She supports this $106 billion that they\\'re trying to get through Congress. Where is some of that money going? They\\'ve done tens of billions of dollars to pay salaries for Ukrainian government bureaucrats. They\\'ve paid pensions for Ukrainian retirees with your tax dollars?</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve got homeless veterans. We have all these problems. This is the U.N. way of thinking that we\\'re somehow globalists and we have unlimited resources to do. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>You know, I think here\\'s the problem. You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations, but you can\\'t take the United Nations out of the ambassador. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, I have never said that we should give salaries or benefits or anything else to Ukrainians. I have said it again, Ron, so stop lying. DeSantislies.com.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But you supported the aid packages.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So you go -- I did not support the aid package. I support equipment and ammunition going to Ukraine. I think it is incredibly important that we\\'re honest and say we have to focus on national security. Don\\'t go and lie to the American people to make them think we can\\'t do this.</p>\\n<p>You turned around and raised the debt limit. You\\'re the one that\\'s talked about, look at what you did to Florida. But think about the fact that he is talking about where is this money going to come from. You -- the best way to tell about a candidate is to see how they\\'ve run their campaign.</p>\\n<p>He has blown through $150 million. I don\\'t know how you do that. Through his campaign, he has nothing to show for it. He spent more money on private planes than he has on commercials trying to get Iowans to vote for him. If you can\\'t manage a campaign, how are you going to manage a country? Which is exactly...[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, listen, I\\'m proud of -- I\\'m proud that in the state of Florida, we\\'re ranked number one for economy of all 50 states by CNBC. Number one...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest cost of living.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... in education. She was ranked number 50 in education...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... when she was governor of California (ph)...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest insurance in the country.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, he...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... wasn\\'t able to do school choice. She didn\\'t deliver big tax cuts. We\\'re also number one for net end migration, number one for GDP growth amongst large states, number one for talent development, number one for new business formations, and on and on it goes.</p>\\n<p>So the success we\\'ve had in Florida, I can cite the statistics. It\\'s important. But just look at how people are voting with their feet. They\\'re leaving California. They\\'re leaving Illinois, New York, all these states, and they\\'re coming to Florida in record numbers because we\\'re doing it right.</p>\\n<p>And not only have I cut taxes big time, where she didn\\'t as governor of South Carolina, we\\'ve paid down 25 percent of our state\\'s debt. That\\'s how you manage the third-largest state in this country. Just imagine if we could do that for the United States of America. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So thank you. Let\\'s stay on foreign policy. I want to turn to the Israel-Hamas war. You both have said that you unequivocally support Israel. You both have called for the complete elimination of Hamas.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, there are real disagreements within Israel about how to handle what happens in Gaza after the war against Hamas is over. Some Israeli cabinet officials are pushing for the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza. Governor Haley told CNN last week she does not support that. Do you?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So we\\'ve got to support Israel in word and in deed, in public and in private. And they need to be able to finish the job. Joe Biden is kneecapping them. He\\'ll say one thing, then he goes and his base doesn\\'t like Israel, so he has got to do all these other things. This is a time to recognize that they\\'ve suffered the most deaths of Jews, murder of Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas wants a second Holocaust. They want to annihilate the state of Israel. So I think to be a good ally, you back them in the decisions that they\\'re making with respect to Gaza.</p>\\n<p>Look, there\\'s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you\\'re doing this. But for us to be sitting in Washington second guessing them, I don\\'t think that\\'s the right way.</p>\\n<p>We also have a disagreement. Governor Haley and I, when she was at the U.N., she supported the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs. The problem with that is the Palestinian Arabs don\\'t recognize Israel\\'s right to exist as a Jewish state. So doing a two-state solution doesn\\'t create something that\\'s going to lead to a lasting peace. It creates a stepping stone for Israel\\'s destruction.</p>\\n<p>So under no circumstances as president am I going to pressure Israel to risk their security to do a so called two-state solution. She was wrong when she embraced that. And we\\'re right to say we trust Israel to make these decisions. They\\'re a good ally of ours. We should trust their judgment on these sensitive issues.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, 15 seconds, 15 seconds clarification. Do you support the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So as president, I am not going to tell them to do that. I think there\\'s a lot of issues with that. But if they make the calculation that to avert a second holocaust, they need to do that. I think some of these Palestinian Arabs, Saudi Arabia should take some.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Egypt should take some. They\\'ve never been willing to accept any of these facts in their own neighborhood.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor. Thank you, governor. Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, we need to understand the reason we need to support Israel is Israel\\'s a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. They are the tip of the spear when it comes to defeating terrorism. It has never been that Israel needs America. It has always been that America needs Israel.</p>\\n<p>When I was at the United Nations, I fought every day for Israel. And if you would have listened to what I said at the United Nations, a two-state solution wasn\\'t something that was possible because Israel would always come to the table and the Palestinians wouldn\\'t.</p>\\n<p>But right now, we have to make sure that Israel has the support that it needs. There should be three things. Give Israel whatever it wants to get the job done. Two, eliminate Hamas once and for all. And three, do whatever it takes to bring the hostages home.</p>\\n<p>But it\\'s really rich that Ron is going to act like he suddenly cares for Israel when he brought the person to Iowa that\\'s the most anti- Israel Republican in the state, the person that went and voted against Israel\\'s right to exist in Congress, the person that voted with the squad against antisemitism on college campuses.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> And you brought that person --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- to Iowa to go and campaign with. That\\'s your friend.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, she\\'s obviously referring to Congressman Tom Massey from Kentucky.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yes. I mean, that\\'s just cheap garbage. But here\\'s the thing. When the attack --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> -- happened against Israel, I knew it was going to be a big deal for Florida. We have one of the largest Israeli American populations in the country, and we\\'ve been a haven for orthodox Jews in particular since I\\'ve been governor. And you know what? Biden wasn\\'t helping Americans get out of the war zone. These are people that were stranded. So I did an executive order. We scrambled planes and we rescued over 700 Americans from Israel and brought them back safely to the state of Florida. You got to step up and you got to lead when things like this are happening.</p>\\n<p>We also have gone after the antisemitism on our campuses. We did that early in my administration. You didn\\'t see our college presidents doing some of the things that you\\'ve seen.</p>\\n<p>I just announced in the state of the state address yesterday or two days ago that we are going to say not just for Jewish students, anyone who\\'s having religious, being persecuted or being marginalized because of their faith in any college around the country, we\\'re going to waive the transfer requirements so that people can come to Florida and be safe.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> What they are doing to Jewish students has been reprehensible.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We\\'re not going to let it out.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So there are -- I\\'m coming to you. There are growing fears of this war escalating into a broader regional conflict. And, Governor Haley, just yesterday the U.S. Navy shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by Iranian backed militants in the Red Sea. Iranian backed militants are now also attacking U.S. and western interests in Syria and Iraq. Your fellow South Carolinian Republican senator Lindsey Graham is calling for the U.S. to conduct retaliatory strikes inside Iran. Would you order strikes inside Iran?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, notice Ron didn\\'t say anything about the fact that he did bring that most anti-Israel Republican into this state to campaign. He also hasn\\'t told you that the only Republican Jewish state legislator left his campaign because he wasn\\'t dealing with the neo-Nazi marches and wasn\\'t dealing with antisemitism properly.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to Iran, what we have to understand, there would be no Hamas without Iran. There would not be Houthis without Iran. There wouldn\\'t be Hezbollah without Iran. And when you look at the strikes that are happening in Iraq and Syria, that is because of Ron. They\\'re pulling the puppet strings.</p>\\n<p>What we need to do is the idea that we\\'ve had over 130 strikes on our men and women in Iraq and Syria is unconscionable. We\\'re supposed to have their backs. And Biden has been slow. He\\'s been hiding in a corner and he hasn\\'t dealt with it.</p>\\n<p>We need to go and take out every bit of the production that they have that\\'s allowing them to do those strikes. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. And you can\\'t do that if you have a secretary of defense that is in ICU and the president doesn\\'t even know about it.</p>\\n<p>Look, there\\'s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you\\'re doing this.

They fund Hamas. They fund Hezbollah. We did a special session of the legislature down in Florida. We expanded sanctions against Iran. If we were our own country, we\\'d be the 14th largest economy in the world.</p>\\n<p>The root of this is Biden came into office and he relaxed the sanctions on Iran.

And that is, what is the role of government, and should it use its power to go after businesses and private entities that take actions that don\\'t align with conservative values?</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, you used your powers in Florida to take on Disney after the company criticized an education bill that you signed into law. How does that square with the traditional conservative view that small, limited government is best?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The proper role of government, if it means every -- anything, it\\'s to protect our kids.</p>\\n<p>And I have stood for the innocence of our kids. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>It is wrong -- it is wrong to sexualize the curriculum. It\\'s wrong -- my wife and I, we have got a first grader, a kindergarten and a preschooler.</p>\\n<p>This is something that\\'s important to us personally. It\\'s wrong to tell a kindergartner, like Disney wanted to do, that you can change your gender or tell a third grader that you\\'re born in the wrong body. So I stood up against -- yes, the media didn\\'t like it, the left didn\\'t like it, and Disney didn\\'t like it.</p>\\n<p>And they\\'re the 800-pound gorilla in the state of Florida. Most people, most corporate Republicans would have caved. I stood and I fought for the kids. We took on Disney, and we defeated that and we won that fight and our kids are better off.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley sided with Disney. She invited them to South Carolina, even though they were involved in transing kids. That is not what we need to do. But I think that\\'s similar. She is representative of this corporatist element of the party. For example, she supported $900 million in subsidies to Boeing when she was in South Carolina. And then, when she got out of office, she took a seat on their board, and she made millions of dollars. Then she gave speeches, paid speeches, to a lot of Wall Street interests, didn\\'t publish what she said. We don\\'t know what she promised them.</p>\\n<p>And she made millions of dollars doing that. Now they\\'re the ones that are funding her campaign. So we need to stand up for the people, and not bow down to woke corporations. And we know Nikki Haley will cave to the woke mob every single time. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, a response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people.</p>\\n<p>And what we don\\'t need is government politicizing anything. The first thing I will say is, again, DeSantislies.com, because I have never said anything related to the transgender stuff he says. I have always fought to protect kids. I have always said that boys need to go into boys\\' bathrooms, girls need to go into girls\\' bathrooms, that we shouldn\\'t have any gender transitions before the age of 18.</p>\\n<p>Just like we don\\'t have tattoos before the age of 18, we shouldn\\'t have gender transformation or puberty blockers. But I will tell you that it\\'s really interesting that Ron talks about this -- Disney, because Disney has been woke for a long time.</p>\\n<p>They were against the immigration situation that Trump was doing. They were against the Paris climate agreement when I did it. They were against the pro-life bill in Georgia. Ron didn\\'t have any problem with that. As a matter of fact, he gave them the largest corporate subsidies in Florida history.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That\\'s false.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> He had tech exemptions that he gave -- didn\\'t give any tech exemptions to anybody but Disney.</p>\\n<p>Yet, when they went and criticized him, he got thin-skinned and suddenly started to fight back. We don\\'t need government fighting against our private industries. We are not woke in South Carolina. I will always invite businesses to come to South Carolina.</p>\\n<p>But the one thing you don\\'t do is, government doesn\\'t bully our businesses. And that can\\'t happen. And Ron has determined anybody that offends him...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... he goes after them, and he will use government...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She just said she\\'s always fought to protect kids.

I\\'m glad she\\'s come to the right thing.</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the deal, it goes back to that young kid in the town hall that she had where he said, Nikki Haley, you are the new John Kerry, you are for it before you were against it.

And if there are any other exceptions, they use a private bathroom.</p>\\n<p>I have fought for women\\'s sports and making sure that biological boys are not in women\\'s sports.

Given that, why should voters concerned about K through 12 education support you rather than other Republicans?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Because I think what we did was we knew that there was an issue. We knew in South Carolina if a child couldn\\'t read by third grade they were four times less likely to graduate high school. So what we did is, we started holding kids back instead of pushing them forward. We brought in their parents. We did reading remediation. And we set them up for success.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve got to do that all over the country. We only had 31 percent of eighth graders in the country are proficient in reading, 27 percent of eighth graders are proficient in math. If we don\\'t do something, we\\'re going to be in a world of hurt 10 years from now.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s why I want to take as many federal programs from D.C. as we can and send them down to the state level. Think education. We can move a lot of K through 12 programs down to the state level, reduce the strings that are attached, and that way states can handle it themselves. People in Iowa know best what types of education they need.</p>\\n<p>Secondly, parents should decide what types of education their children get, what mode of education. And we should have complete transparency in the classroom. No parent should ever wonder what\\'s being said or taught to their child in the classroom. That\\'s why we\\'ll have all of the curriculums online for every parent to see.</p>\\n<p>And we need to start putting vocational classes back in our high schools. Let\\'s teach our kids how to do things. We did that in South Carolina. We had apprenticeships. We taught our kids how to build the things we are making.</p>\\n<p>When we start putting education back in the states and away from D.C., that\\'s when we\\'ll start to see that we are going back to the basics. We\\'re doing what parents want. And we\\'re doing what the industries...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... in that state need.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, I\\'m coming to you right now. Governor DeSantis, you have supported limits on what subjects can be taught and how, including American history in Florida schools. You have also made it easier to remove books from public school libraries. You say you want to, quote, \"make America Florida.\" Do you want to implement those Florida school policies nationwide?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I\\'ll get to that in a sec. So Nikki Haley said she wants parents to decide on the education. She campaigned for governor saying she was going to do school choice, to be able to give private scholarships, particularly to low-income families. And she was governor and never did it. She caved to the teachers union.</p>\\n<p>I delivered the biggest school choice expansion in the history of the United States. We beat the teachers union. We\\'ve even done paycheck protection so that school unions -- so that teachers aren\\'t force to do dues, and now they\\'re choosing other things. So we\\'ve done it right in Florida. And the results speak for themselves.</p>\\n<p>We have one of the top performing fourth grade reading and math in the country. And if you just took our charter school population, 365,000 kids, disproportionately low income, racial, ethnic minorities, if they were their own state, they\\'d be in the top five in performance. Everyone can succeed, but you\\'ve got to have a leader who\\'s going to fight the teachers unions and is going to deliver school choice.</p>\\n<p>Governor Kim Reynolds did that here in Iowa, who\\'s endorsed me. Nikki Haley did not. She failed. And if she can\\'t do it in the reddest state in the country of South Carolina, how are you going to be able to succeed in Washington, D.C.?</p>\\n<p>Now, in terms of what we\\'ve done, we believe in empowering parents, and there are certain standards about what\\'s age and developmentally appropriate. It\\'s wrong to have pornographic materials in fourth or fifth grade. And you know what\\'s happened? They\\'ll go to school board meetings all around the country. They\\'ll start reading it and they, oh, no, no, it\\'s too graphic. You can\\'t read it here. You can\\'t put it on the 6:00 news.</p>\\n<p>Well, if it\\'s not appropriate in a school board meeting and you can\\'t put on the 6:00 news, why are you jamming it down the throats of a fourth grader?</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor, just a point of clarification, do you want to implement Florida\\'s education policies nationwide?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> It depends on the policy. School choice universal, yes. I don\\'t want a nationalized curriculum. I think that that\\'s a bottom up thing. I want to get rid of the federal Department of Education, get that weight off the backs of the state and local governments. But we are going to do nationwide scholarships through the tax credits, and that\\'s going to bail out a lot of poor kids throughout this country.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I have fought for school choice in my entire career because I think parents know their children best, and I think we should always do that. That\\'s why we passed charter school legislation in our state. That\\'s why we empowered homeschoolers in our state. That\\'s why we changed the funding formula. So, we lifted up challenged areas without bringing down the wealthy areas.</p>\\n<p>We wanted school choice. I had a Republican legislature that wouldn\\'t do it, but we pushed hard to get that done. That doesn\\'t mean that we shouldn\\'t do it across the country. But what we have to do is we have to make it state centric. We\\'ve got to get these programs down to the state level. We\\'ve got to let the focus be on teachers. Teachers right now have to be the guidance counselors, the pastors, the nurses and everything in between. And, oh, by the way, they have to teach to a test. That\\'s not what teachers want. Teachers want to do what they were taught to do. And that means math, science, reading, history, English, arts. That\\'s it.</p>\\n<p>Schools can\\'t be all things to all kids. They need to let the parents parent. They need to let teachers teach. And we need to go back to the basics in education so we get our kids --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. I want to move on.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That is the problem, though. That word salad is the problem.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She said she\\'s always supported school choice and she failed to deliver. She blames other people. Leadership is about getting things done. Stop making excuses. Make it happen.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> If leadership is about getting things done, how did you blow through $150 million in your campaign, and you were down in the polls. You are not a man of word. No, I\\'m going to say --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think it\\'s very instructive about what Nikki Haley sees the world.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think I have the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, Governor Haley --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> What is more important here? She\\'s saying somehow that that\\'s not --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, it\\'s Governor Haley\\'s time. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think I hit a nerve. What I will tell you is, look, if you can\\'t manage a campaign -- it\\'s been a revolving door of political people in and out of his campaign. You\\'ve heard of campaign people going to blows with each other because they can\\'t all agree. $150 million, and he spent more on private planes than commercials. I flew commercial. I stayed in residence inns. We went and saved our money. We made sure we spent it right because you have to understand, it\\'s not your money, it\\'s other people\\'s money, and you have to know how to handle it. If he can\\'t handle the financial parts of a campaign, how is he going to handle the economy when it comes to the White House?</p>\\n<p>And he goes, and he has been demeaning me over and over again, telling lies, desantislies.com, because he thinks it makes him look bigger. But in the one basic thing, you\\'ve campaigned for president in one state, you\\'re invisible in New Hampshire, you\\'re invisible. In South Carolina, you\\'re in fifth place, you\\'ve got $150 million and you\\'ve gone down in the polls in Iowa. Why should we think you can manage or do anything in this country?</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> This is a great window into leadership because she focused on a lot of political process stuff, things that no voter cares about, and she couldn\\'t tell you why she failed to deliver school choice to people in her state after she promised it. So, she says somehow that is the indicative of me.</p>\\n<p>No, leadership is about producing results. We\\'ve produced the results in Florida. We did universal school choice. We\\'ve cut taxes, we banned sanctuary cities on and on down the line, everything I promised, I delivered. She doesn\\'t have a rationale for why she couldn\\'t get it done. That is poor leadership. You look at me. Everything I promised I would do, I\\'ve delivered. And you can expect nothing less when I\\'m the president of the United States.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re going to move on now.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I need to respond to that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, you want to talk about leadership, and he wants to go and demean and put down. Let me tell you what leadership is. Leadership is the fact that I went into South Carolina that had 11 percent unemployment rate. Leadership is the fact that we turned it into an economic powerhouse, building planes, building cars, building tires.</p>\\n<p>We were named the beasts of the southeast. We moved the 11 percent unemployment down to 4 percent. We announced jobs in every county in the state. We moved 35,000 people on welfare to work. We changed our prison system to where we now have the lowest recidivism rate in the country. We passed voter I.D. We passed tort reform. We did pension form. We paid down our debt. We cut taxes. We made sure that people were proud again. We did eVerify in the first six months, not five years, like Ron.</p>\\n<p>So, don\\'t go and pick on school choice and say that that\\'s leadership. When I got to the U.N., we cut a billion dollars off the top, and we took the kick me sign off of our backs, and America was respected again at the U.N. I know what leadership is.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re moving on to a topic, governors, that both of you have made central to your campaigns, and that is China. Governor Haley, American farmers were hurt by former President Trump\\'s trade war with China. As a result, his administration paid out $28 billion in subsidies to farmers. You have vowed to be even tougher than Donald Trump on China. If your trade policies also end up hurting America\\'s farmers, are you prepared to cut a check just like he did?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, that\\'s why Trump should be here on this debate stage. He should have to defend it. So, first of all, I\\'ve said China is our number one national security threat. I fought them every single day at the United Nations. I know what they\\'re capable of. The first thing we have to do is we have to make sure we stop selling them any land and we take back the land they already purchased. We need to go to our universities and we say, you either take Chinese money or you take American money but the days of taking both are over. We need to stop all of the technologies that are going to China. Biden approved 70 percent of them. Trump approved even more than that. We have to tell them we\\'re going to end all normal trade relations with them until they stop murdering Americans with fentanyl. And we need to make sure we build up our military.</p>\\n<p>But the biggest thing, I was very attached to China in terms of trade, and the one thing we\\'ll do is we won\\'t wait for the China to pull the rug out from under Iowans. What we\\'ll do is instead, we will move that trade to where we have friends. We will go and build partnerships, India, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Australia, Israel. We will go and move that trade over.</p>\\n<p>Right now, you can ask our farmers when they go and they buy from China, China orders, cancels the order, then goes and tries to buy it cheap. That\\'s what China does. Our farmers deserve better than that. We will get them trade deals.</p>\\n<p>When I was governor in South Carolina, we sold and we exported everything we were making in South Carolina. When I\\'m president, we will sell and export everything that\\'s being made in Iowa to those that are our friends, not our enemies.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor DeSantis, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The way you deal with China is threefold. One, we need more hard power in the Indo-Pacific. I\\'m a Navy guy. We need more sea power. We\\'re going to build that up and we\\'re going to have a strategy to deny their ability to invade Taiwan or to get beyond the first island chain. On the current course, they\\'re going to take advantage of Biden and we\\'re going to rue the day when that happens.</p>\\n<p>Second, we got to decouple our economy, particularly things that are significant to our national survival. And you\\'ve got to be methodical, strategic about it. There\\'s a lot of moving parts there. But we\\'re going to do.</p>\\n<p>Nikki Haley\\'s not going to be able to do that because a lot of her supporters make a lot of money in China. And so she\\'s going to talk tough, but she\\'ll cave on that.</p>\\n<p>And then also with here in the United States, she\\'s saying they shouldn\\'t be buying land and be in the universities. When she was governor of South Carolina, the state gave China land and they were in the universities. As governor in Florida, I banned China from buying land and we kicked them out of our universities. That\\'s what you want to do.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> DeSantislies.com, he has an economic development arm. You had an office in Hong Kong. On the website, it said that Florida is a great place for Chinese companies to do business. And then when we called you out on it, you had the website scrubbed. So, we know that that\\'s the case. What I will tell you is we need to focus on what we\\'re going to do to become less dependent on China, and we need to make sure that we look at it through a national security lens.</p>\\n<p>When we had COVID, everybody told you to wear a mask. It was made in China. They told you to take a COVID test, you turned it over, it was made in China. If you go down the drugstore aisle, all those medicines are made in China. We need to make sure we\\'re getting medicines made here or we need to get it from our friends so that we\\'re not, in any way, threatened.</p>\\n<p>But I\\'ll tell you, Ron continues to sit there and talk about China. He has done expansions in China. His biggest donor that is backed by China gave them $340,000. So, don\\'t go and talk about donors and money. Go to desantislies.com and we\\'ll tell you all about it.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Look, I know your record hurts. I know your record sometimes because you\\'re being -- you\\'re talking the opposite of what you did. You were made a big effort to bring them into the state.</p>\\n<p>They had land near military base. You were in front of the Chinese flags saying you work for them. You wrote a love letter to the ambassador. That\\'s well-documented. You were the number one Republican governor in the country.</p>\\n<p>And even people that on the media who are hostile to me, they look, they say they can\\'t find one instance of me as governor recruiting a Chinese company because I haven\\'t done it. It\\'s not been part of that.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Desantislies.com is on there. It\\'s on there.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And the Enterprise Florida, we actually eliminated.</p>\\n<p>So, here\\'s the thing though. She\\'s backed by companies like BlackRock. She\\'s backed by major companies on Wall Street. They make a lot of money in China. There\\'s a reason why you\\'re in the mess you are in terms of trying to deal with the inflation and everything because the elites in this country have sold out the middle of the country for China. She is part of that now. And she\\'s not going to stand up for you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> I want to ask about something that you mentioned you\\'ve been talking a lot about on the campaign trail, which is decoupling the U.S. economy with China\\'s. China is a top supplier of goods to the United States. The U.S. sells more than $150 billion of goods to China every year. Is it really possible to sever economic ties without inflicting major pain on American business and American consumers?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Sure it is, and it\\'s something that you\\'ve got to be strategic, you\\'ve got to be methodical about. You\\'ve got to focus on the things that are of national significance. For example, I don\\'t think it\\'s good idea that the pharmaceuticals come from there, things for our military weaponry, all these important things that if we got into a worldwide conflict, we\\'re going to ask China, who may be on the other side of that, to continue doing that.</p>\\n<p>So, you got to be smart about it. You got to recognize that you\\'re going to have to do some incentives here in this country, tax incentives, regulatory incentives. But I want to make things here again.</p>\\n<p>You know, I look around the country. There\\'s parts of Iowa that have been hollowed out, particularly in the eastern part. And I\\'ve talked to folks and seen what that did for the community. We were sold a bill of goods by a lot of elites in this country that somehow putting China and the WTO and granting a most favorite nation status was going to lead to our manufacturing exporting a bunch of stuff there. Instead, they\\'ve gobbled up so much more manufacturing.</p>\\n<p>I don\\'t think you can be a first rate power unless you have a very strong industrial base. So, we\\'re going to do that here. We\\'re going to work on workforce education. Not everyone needs to do a four-year Brick and Ivy University. That\\'s not the best way or only way for people to succeed. We\\'re going to do skilled trades. We\\'re going to do vocational. We\\'ve done that in Florida. It\\'s going to be a really, really big thing.</p>\\n<p>But I just think the middle of the country has to have those good- paying jobs and we can\\'t put the interest of some of the people on Wall Street over the interests of Americans on Main Street.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Let\\'s move on to Social Security. Let\\'s move on to Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, Social Security will be unable to pay full benefits in a decade if no action is taken.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, you have said that you\\'re not going to, quote, mess with Social Security, unquote. Does that mean you have committed to never raising the retirement age and never cutting benefits?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So, all seniors out there, promise has been made to you. You\\'ve paid into this. Every single paycheck that you\\'ve had your entire life they\\'ve taken money out of, and that promise needs to be fulfilled.</p>\\n<p>So, that will happen when I\\'m president. Of course, I have a lot of seniors in Florida that depend on Social Security. I know many of them. And I think back to my own grandmother who was -- lived until 91. Social Security was her sole source of income. So, promise made, promise kept.</p>\\n<p>You know, on the retirement age, you know, there used to be people would say, well, life expectancy is going up. Shouldn\\'t it mirror that? Well, the problem now in the last five years is life expectancy is going down. So, I don\\'t see how you can raise the retirement age when our life expectancy is collapsing in this country. That\\'s a huge problem in and of itself.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ll work with both sides of the aisle. We\\'ll work on something for the long-term strengthening, but I am not going to mess with seniors\\' benefits. In this high-inflation environment, groceries are going through the roof, rent is going through the roof, all these staples, and you get a cost of living adjustment, but that\\'s not enough to cover the costs that have been increased.</p>\\n<p>So, seniors are really strapped, particularly those that are on fixed income, and they have to know that we\\'re going to deliver when it comes to their Social Security check.</p>\\n<p>Now, we\\'re going to get inflation down. We\\'re going to get energy costs down. There\\'s going to be a lot of things that are going to help seniors, but I think seniors should know promise made will be a promise kept.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So just a point of clarification, 15 seconds, removing current seniors from the equation, you\\'re not saying that you\\'re committing to never raising the retirement age or cutting benefits.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I would never raise the retirement age in the face of a declining life expectancy. I mean, I think that that would be really bad. I mean, just think about it, that hurts blue collar folks. You get taxed your entire life, life expectancy is down. You may not even be recouping very many benefits. And so life expectancy is declining. That\\'s a big problem.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Three years in a row, he voted to raise life expectancy to 70 years old, three years in a row. Go to desantislies.com and you\\'ll see it. So, now suddenly he\\'s going to tell you because he\\'s running for president and he\\'s not going to do it, you can\\'t trust him.</p>\\n<p>What I\\'ll tell you is Social Security is going to go bankrupt in ten years. Medicare is going to go bankrupt in eight. He talks about taking care of seniors right now, Florida is the inflation hotspot. It\\'s the highest cost of living of any state in the country. Seniors are having to leave because they can\\'t afford it. It\\'s documented in desantislies.com.</p>\\n<p>What I\\'ll tell you we have to do is we have to keep our promises to senior years, but we also can\\'t put our head in the sand for those like Ron saying they\\'re not going to touch Social Security. That means they\\'re going to leave after four or eight years and leave it bankrupt. No.</p>\\n<p>What we do is we go to those in their 20s and say we\\'re going to change the retirement age to reflect life expectancy. Instead of cost of living increases, we do increases based on inflation. We\\'d limit benefits on the wealthy and we expand Medicare advantage plans with seniors. That\\'s how we\\'ll deal with --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> With reducing the benefits, when you do the change in calculation, reducing the benefits, let\\'s just put this in perspective, under her administration, you would have seniors getting less cost of living adjustments while your tax dollars are going to pay the pensions of Ukrainian bureaucrats.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> That\\'s not true. That\\'s such a lie, Ron.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You talk about putting Americans last. That is wrong. You\\'ve supported all that money going over there. So, let\\'s put our own people first.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You\\'re so desperate. You\\'re just so desperate.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, let him speak.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And she also said -- she said recently that the age of Social Security is way too low, and I criticized that. And then she was called on it. And then she said, she never said it, of course, you\\'re lying. And then, sure enough, you put on the interview where she\\'s there, splitting image, and she says it\\'s way too low.</p>\\n<p>So, we can play this song and dance. She has a record. She makes statements. And I think part of the problem with her candidacy is now that she\\'s getting scrutiny, she\\'s got this problem with ballistic podiatry, shooting herself in the foot every other day, saying things that now she doesn\\'t even take questions from people.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, you want to raise the retirement age for younger Americans, but you have not said what that age should be. Should voters in their 20s plan on working until they\\'re 70?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, he hasn\\'t answered the fact that he voted to raise the retirement age to 73 different times. He can call me whatever name and be demeaning as much as he wants. It doesn\\'t change the fact that Ron is lying because Ron is losing. Everybody in the country sees it for what it is.</p>\\n<p>So, what I\\'ll tell you is, yes, we\\'re going to take on -- we\\'re going to be responsible with it and we\\'re going to go to those in our 20s.</p>\\n<p>When I said the retirement age was too low, again, where he\\'s lying, it\\'s because if you go, and you can go to desantislies.com, I said it\\'s too low, if we\\'re going to look at those in their 20s. We have to go and start looking at what we can do to get out of this. We want to make sure that everybody who was promised gets it.</p>\\n<p>But we also want to make sure our kids have something when they get it, too. So, the way we do that is exactly how I laid it out. Then we\\'ll know what we\\'re looking at and then we can start focusing.</p>\\n<p>The other thing is we need to start cutting spending in D.C. We have to go back to pre-COVID levels. That\\'s why I\\'ll veto any spending bill that doesn\\'t take us back to pre-COVID levels. That will save us trillions. We\\'ve got to go into every agency, replace the head of every agency and send people into every agency.</p>\\n<p>I did that as governor. Pull down old regs, pull down old programs, get rid of any problem children and clean those agencies out and get them mission-focused. There is a lot of waste in D.C. You need an accountant to go in there and clean it up. But we\\'re not going to take away from anyone else and he\\'s yet to answer the fact that he voted three times to raise the retirement age.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Just a clarification, Governor Haley, in 15 seconds, should voters in their 20s plan on having to work until they\\'re 70?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> They should plan on their retirement age being increased, yes. We\\'re going to change it to reflect more of what life expectancy should be.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, one of the things that I think we disagree on, too, is Governor Haley has said Social Security is an entitlement, but it\\'s not an entitlement. You\\'re paying into it. It\\'s not a welfare program. You\\'re being taxed for this your whole life. And so to expect to have benefits on the backend, I don\\'t think that that\\'s too much.</p>\\n<p>The other thing I\\'d point out is Social Security for decades ran massive surpluses. What happened to those surpluses? The Congress spent the surpluses.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Yes, when you paid the debt.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They have a big problem with that. So, number one, we need term limits for members of Congress. Number two, we need a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Number three, we need to give the president a line item veto. And, number four, when you see all these Congressmen making a killing in the stock market, like Nancy Pelosi, she could run a very lucrative hedge fund, we need a 28th Amendment to the Constitution that says very simply Congress shall make no law respecting the citizens of the United States that does not also apply to members of Congress themselves.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> I want to turn now to the topic abortion, which, of course, has been hotly debated in this Republican primary campaign.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, last week Governor DeSantis said that former President Trump is not pro-life. Do you agree?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, look, I think that he did some pro-life things when he was president. You\\'d have to ask him. That\\'s why he should be on this debate stage.</p>\\n<p>Don\\'t ask me what President Trump thinks. You need to have him on this debate stage and ask him for yourself.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, look, I think that we\\'ve stood very strongly for a culture of life. Governor Reynolds is here. She has stood strongly for a culture of life and a national life protection. We\\'ve done it in the state of Florida. Donald Trump has attacked that.</p>\\n<p>What they did under Governor Reynolds here in Iowa, he said that that\\'s a, quote, terrible, terrible thing. I don\\'t know how you square that. He was at the March for Life when he was president his last year and he said that life\\'s a gift from God, that the unborn are made in the image of God and that you needed to have protections for that human life. And now saying it\\'s a terrible, terrible thing, he\\'s given a gift to the left to weaponize that against pro-lifers, and that\\'s wrong.</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the thing. Republicans need to do a better job of lifting up folks who are having children. It\\'s very difficult to raise kids in this environment. You need the help with medical care. You need the help with affordability, and we need the help with education, choice. You got to be pro-life for the whole life, and you got to have some compassion for what is going on in this country.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. Oh, I\\'m sorry. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor, yesterday in Iowa, you criticized Governor Haley on this issue of abortion. You said she\\'s, quote, indulged in left wing tropes and chastised pro-lifers. Do you believe Governor Haley is sufficiently pro-life?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think she\\'s been confused on the issue. I think she\\'s trying to speak to different groups with different things. But when she says things like pro-lifers need to stop talking about throwing women in jail, that\\'s a trope. No one I\\'ve ever met thinks that that\\'s something that\\'s appropriate. These women are in vulnerable situations. They don\\'t get any help a lot of times from these fathers who don\\'t want to be there supportive. A lot of times they don\\'t have resources themselves.</p>\\n<p>So, it\\'s a very difficult situation and we\\'ve got to have compassion for those situations. But I think when she starts bringing that in, that\\'s using the language of the left to try to attack pro-lifers.</p>\\n<p>So, I think that that is wrong. But at the end of the day, I do agree with her on this. Donald Trump should be on this stage. He owes it to you here in Iowa to explain this change he\\'s had in his positioning, to explain why he has a tough time saying whether a man can become a woman or not, to explain why he wants to build a billion dollar-plus big, beautiful, new FBI building right in the heart of the swamp in Washington, D.C. He needs to explain why he didn\\'t build the wall and why he added $7.8 trillion to the debt.</p>\\n<p>Every candidate needs to earn your vote. Nobody is entitled to your vote. And he comes in here every now and then, he does his spiel, and then he leaves. I\\'ve shown up to all 99 counties because it\\'s important. You\\'re a servant of the people. You are not a ruler over the people. And that\\'s the type of president that I will be for you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I didn\\'t hear the criticism from Ron about me for being pro- life, but I\\'m not surprised. It\\'s something that he does all day, every day. I am unapologetically pro-life, not because the Republican Party tells me to be, but because my husband is adopted and I\\'ve got my two sweet children sitting in front of me and I had trouble having both of them.</p>\\n<p>These fellows don\\'t know how to talk about abortion. I have said over and over again, the Democrats put fear in women on abortion and Republicans have used judgment. This is too personal of an issue to put fear or judgment.</p>\\n<p>Our goal should be how do we save as many babies as possible and support as many moms as possible. That\\'s what we\\'re going to focus on doing. We\\'re not going to demonize this issue anymore. We\\'re not going to play politics with this issue anymore. We\\'re going to treat it like the respectful issue that it is.</p>\\n<p>And the tropes that you want to talk about, you keep saying, where is anybody talking about putting a woman in jail or giving her the death penalty? South Carolina. There is legislation right now that would put a woman in jail if she got an abortion. That\\'s why I say that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>So, I do want to remind the viewers at home, both governors have mentioned that they believe that Donald Trump should be here defending his own record. I just want to remind everybody that he did qualify for this debate and he did not accept our invitation.</p>\\n<p>Both of you talked about how important it is to protect the U.S. Constitution. Two years after losing the 2020 election, Donald Trump wrote on social media about his baseless election lies, quote, a massive fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution, unquote. On that subject, former Vice President Mike Pence has said that on January 6th, 2021, Donald Trump put himself over the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, look, you take an oath to the Constitution, and I think what you\\'re seeing is Donald Trump basically said that the election was stolen. He went on and on talking about the election being stolen.</p>\\n<p>He said that January 6th was a beautiful day. I think January 6th was a terrible day and we should never want to see that happen again.</p>\\n<p>And I think we have to always be strong on the fact that, look, we want fair elections and we saw some discrepancies in those elections in 2020 that should be concerning. That\\'s why I passed voter I.D. in South Carolina. That\\'s why I think when absentee ballots go out, you should be able to verify signatures. That\\'s why I think ballots need to be counted on Election Day and you should get results on Election Day.</p>\\n<p>But that election, Trump lost it. Biden won that election. And the idea that he\\'s gone and carried this out forever to the point that he\\'s going to continue to say these things to scare the American people are wrong. We\\'ve seen a lot of states come together and do more election integrity bills. We need to do more than that. We still have three or four states that I\\'m worried about that don\\'t have that.</p>\\n<p>But at the end of the day, I will always defend and fight for the Constitution. That\\'s what we should do as Americans. I think what happened on January 6th was a terrible day and I think President Trump will have to answer for it.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, just a clarification, Governor, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I mean, I think that he says in January 6th was a beautiful day. I don\\'t think it was a beautiful day. I think you look at that. He thinks that he could go and bring in -- the fact that he wanted to change what the states did, the fact that he wanted to overturn the elections in D.C., those votes happen at the state level. You don\\'t ever allow in D.C. for those votes to be changed at the federal level.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> States rights matter.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> My role model for how to do the Constitution is George Washington. He said, the Constitution is the guide that I will never abandon. And I remember when I took an oath to be an officer in the U.S. Navy. You raise that hand, you put that left hand on the Bible. And it\\'s interesting, the oath doesn\\'t say that you\\'re going to defend the shores of the United States or engage in military conflict.</p>\\n<p>The oath simply says that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States. As President of the United States, you will preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. You can\\'t just terminate the Constitution. I mean, I know he does word vomit from time to time on social media, but, obviously, I will uphold the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>And I think it\\'s fine to criticize Donald Trump, and I know the media brings it up a lot. But you know who else deserves to be criticized? The people that violated the Constitution during COVID to lock people out of schools, to destroy businesses, to force masks on people, to try to force vaccines. I\\'m going to bring a reckoning to all these agencies, the CDC, the NIH, the FDA, they harm people in this country. And when Dr. Fauci said there was no learning loss for kids, that\\'s a disgrace.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> There\\'s a reckoning coming.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, let\\'s talk about how you view the powers of the presidency because your opponent, Donald Trump, was in court yesterday for a hearing on presidential immunity. And, Governor DeSantis, I\\'m wondering if you agree with the argument that Donald Trump\\'s lawyer made in court that a president should have immunity for any conduct in office, including, as the judge asked, ordering the assassination of a political rival unless the president gets impeached and convicted by the Senate for the offense first.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, obviously, that attorney gave the case away on that explanation. I think the D.C. Circuit is going to rule against Donald Trump on that issue. I\\'m not exactly sure what the outer limits are. I don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily been litigated. It\\'s not going to be an issue with me, because I\\'m always going to follow the Constitution. And we\\'re going to uphold the best traditions of the office. And I\\'m going to be a president you can be proud of.</p>\\n<p>I think it\\'s important that people would be able to look to the president and say, hey, that\\'s somebody that\\'s worthy of emulating. And so my wife and I, we just view ourselves to try to do well for our kids and to make sure they\\'re proud of us. And we set a good example. So, that\\'s what we would do in that situation.</p>\\n<p>But I think there\\'s a larger issue Republicans have got to think of. Donald Trump is going to lose that appeal. He\\'s going to end up going to trial in front of a stacked left-wing D.C. jury of all Democrats. What are the odds that he\\'s going to get through that? And that\\'s even talking about the validity of the charges. I don\\'t think he gets through that.</p>\\n<p>And so what are we going to do as Republicans in terms of who we nominate for president? If Trump is the nominee, it\\'s going to be about January 6th, legal issues, criminal trials. The Democrats and the media would love to run with that.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m not running for my issues. I\\'m running for your issues. We need to make this election a referendum on the failures of Joe Biden, the failures of the Democratic Party, and how we have the formula to engineer a great comeback for this country. That\\'s what I would do.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley, Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t hear the question.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> The question was, do you agree with the argument Donald Trump\\'s lawyer made in court that a president should have immunity for any conduct, including ordering the assassination of a political rival unless that president is impeached and convicted by Senate for the defense first?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> No, that\\'s ridiculous. That\\'s absolutely ridiculous. I mean, we need to use some common sense here. You can\\'t go and kill a political rival and then claim, you know, immunity from a President. I think we have to start doing things that are right. And you know,</p>\\n<p>Ron said we should have leaders that we can look up to. Well, then stop lying because nobody\\'s going to want to look up to you if you\\'re lying.</p>\\n<p>But what I do think we need to look at is what is what has President Trump done? You look at the last few years and our country is completely divided. It\\'s divided over extremes. It\\'s divided over hatred, it\\'s divided over the fact that people think that if someone doesn\\'t agree with you that they\\'re bad.</p>\\n<p>And now we have leaders in our country that decide who\\'s good and who\\'s bad, who\\'s right and who\\'s wrong. That\\'s not what a leader does. What a leader does is they bring out the best in people and get them to see the way forward.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s what we need in our country. We don\\'t need this chaos anymore. We need someone who\\'s going to be a new generational leader that brings sanity back to America.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you so much. We\\'ll see you then. Republican Presidential Debate live from Drake University. We\\'ll be back right after this.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Iowa, Drake University. Let\\'s start this with health care. Neither of you has released a detailed healthcare plan so we want to give some -- the voters here some insight into specifics of what you might do as President.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, as governor of South Carolina you chose not to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. Forty states including this one where we are in Iowa did expand Medicaid covering more than 18 million Americans. As President, would you allow those states to keep their expansions in place?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, the first thing is we have to look at the fact that how can we be the best country in the world with the most expensive health care in the world? And so the way we\\'re going to deal with it is we\\'re going to open it all up from the hospitals to the insurance companies to the doctor\\'s offices to the pharmaceuticals to the PBMs, make them have to show us everything.</p>\\n<p>Because right now, I can tell you, we take care of my parents. They\\'re 87 and 90. My dad is in the hospital right now. When my mom was in the hospital, a nurse came up to her to give her a couple of Tylenol. And she said, I don\\'t need them. And she said, honey, you might as well take them, because you\\'re going to pay for them anyway. When we got the bill from the hospital, no one talked to us about that.</p>\\n<p>Right now, you have insurance companies and hospitals deciding what it is for us. We\\'re going to take the patient out of the back seat and put them in the driver\\'s seat. We\\'re going to make sure that just like when you get your car fixed, and you go and they say, we can give you a temporary fix, and it\\'ll cost this much money, or we can give you a permanent fix, and it\\'s going to cost that much money. We\\'re going to go and make it transparent so that we can see everything so that they have to show us their words.</p>\\n<p>The second thing is we\\'re going to pass Tort Reform around this country. I did that in South Carolina. Doctors don\\'t give you those 10 tests because they want to. It\\'s for the 90 percent chance they\\'ll get sued. And then we\\'re going to go and eliminate Certificate of Need in this country. I did that in South Carolina, as well. That basically says if you have a hospital here, you can\\'t have another hospital for X number of miles.</p>\\n<p>They do the same thing for surgical centers, for nursing homes. We\\'re going to put competition back in health care so that health care is fighting for the patient. That way, services go up and costs go down.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor Haley, just a 15-second point of clarification. Would you allow the states that accepted Medicaid expansion to keep that?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, the problem with Medicaid is, it needs to be sent down as block grants. Governors can best decide how to do that. Whether they need to use it towards mental health, whether they need to use it towards support services.</p>\\n<p>Right now, I would send all of that down to the states. The problem is they\\'re only sending a small portion of it. They need to send more of that so that states can better take care of it.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis, your response on whether you would allow Iowa and the other 39 states who accepted Medicaid expansion to keep it.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I\\'ve spoken with a lot of folks here in Iowa, and we need health care that\\'s accessible, that\\'s affordable, and that\\'s accountable. And particularly an emphasis on mental health. In every corner of this state, everywhere I\\'ve traveled in the campaign, people are really concerned about mental health with the kids in schools, people that are coming out of service to our country, with veterans, we\\'re going to put a big emphasis on mental health.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve actually delivered on some of these things in Florida. We got accountability for the pharmacy benefit middlemen that are causing your drug prices to go up. So, we have transparency and consumers pay less. And I just beat the federal government to allow the state of Florida to buy prescription drugs from Canada, which is 25 cents on the dollar. What are prescription drugs cost? I want seniors to be able to do.</p>\\n<p>And then finally, we need to upend this COVID and medical authoritarian regime that we saw going around this country during COVID. It\\'s wrong to force vaxes like the COVID shot and say people are going to lose their jobs. That is not going to ever happen on my watch, trust me.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, same. Fifteen-second clarification.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think what you do is you block-grant the program and then let states run the way they see fit to do. But I can tell you this, expanding Medicaid leads to less private coverage. It doesn\\'t necessarily increase access to quality care. I want to actually get people good health care. It\\'s not just about a sheet of paper if you don\\'t get any good doctors that get you entitled for that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor DeSantis mentioned mental health. Let\\'s talk about that. There is a mental health crisis in this country. An estimated 58 million Americans suffer from some type of mental health illness. Governor Haley, you say the mental health crisis is a quote, \"cancer that no one has dealt with\". What do you think is causing the crisis and what would you do to fix it?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think we saw it exacerbated by COVID. I mean with the school lockdowns and everything else we see young people now with more anxiety, stress and depression than ever before. One in three people right now suffer from mental health issues, but if treated, they can live a perfectly normal life.</p>\\n<p>The problem is we don\\'t have enough mental health therapists. We don\\'t have enough mental health treatment centers. We don\\'t have enough addiction centers. And if you happen to be lucky enough to get one of those three, insurance doesn\\'t cover it.</p>\\n<p>We have got to start dealing with this, because it\\'s become a huge issue. And that\\'s why we need to have more Telehealth, so that people can get the mental health care they need right when they need it. We need to have mental health counselors in schools so they can identify when a child has a problem that they can get the help that they need. But right now, we\\'ve got to get access to care. And that\\'s, again, why I want to move those federal programs down to the state level, because states know they need more mental health support.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re not getting the dollars to do it. We don\\'t need D.C. bureaucrats handling that. We need this on the ground so that we can get the mental health centers, get the therapists, and get the help that people need so that they can be healthy again.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, you said right here in Iowa this summer that closing mental health institutions, a policy supported by Ronald Reagan, was a mistake. As President, would you restore federal funding to those mental health institutions?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yes, we need more people in institutionalized settings, unfortunately. But, you know, Governor Haley mentioned, I think, correctly, the devastating mental health consequences for these school closures, a lot of things that happened during COVID, I never recalled seeing her out there fighting the fight. I was on the front lines on that. Governor Kim Reynolds was on the front lines on that.</p>\\n<p>We fought back against the biomedical state. We were attacked by the media. We were attacked by the pharmaceutical companies. We were attacked by the left, attacked by Fauci. We stood and we helped people. And Iowa and Florida had the best schools opening in the entire pandemic because we led. That\\'s what you want to do.</p>\\n<p>Now, in terms of mental health, I\\'ve run into veterans here in Iowa, and I think we have a significant problem with veterans, particularly the post-9-11 veterans, and we know the stats on suicide. It\\'s really, really sad. And as a fellow veteran, as President, I have to put that issue on the front burner.</p>\\n<p>We can\\'t keep turning a blind eye to what\\'s happening to our vets. It\\'s not going to be done just through the VA. And it can\\'t be done just by pumping people with pharmaceuticals. If a veteran has post- traumatic stress, you need more than just that. So, we\\'re going to use the VA to link veterans with resources that are throughout our country.</p>\\n<p>For example, in Florida, we have an organization that trains service dogs to be able to be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. They understand the symptoms, they mitigate it, and you know what? The suicide rate is close to zero as a result of that. We got to think bigger than these bureaucracies, and we\\'ve got to be there for our vets and their mental health.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Turning -- turning to the topic of climate, 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded on Earth, and Americans are already feeling the impact. Just yesterday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the U.S. experienced 28 weather and climate-related disasters that cost at least $1 billion last year -- another record.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, here in Florida. I\\'m sorry, Governor DeSantis, here in Iowa, massive flooding has left farmers underwater. In Florida, rising seas threaten coastal cities. You have taken action in your home state to mitigate the problems of rising seas. But as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So, on day one as President, we take Biden\\'s Green New Deal. We tear it up and we throw it in the trash can. It is bad for this country. We have to have reliable energy. And here\\'s the thing, you know, they talk about -- Joe Biden has said that global warming is worse than a nuclear war. And I\\'m just thinking to myself, well, gee, John Kerry hasn\\'t given up his private jet. Obama hasn\\'t given up his Martha\\'s Vineyard seaside mansion. I haven\\'t seen Biden do anything to hold China accountable except making sure that Hunter gets his money.</p>\\n<p>So, these guys talk out of one side of their mouth and then they behave in another way. And I think that\\'s wrong. But I also think that those policies would devastate communities, particularly here in Iowa. I mean, for example, he wants to mandate electric vehicles. That\\'s going to be more costly.</p>\\n<p>I think the car companies would go bankrupt, but it\\'s going to hurt liquid fuels, which is very, very important. You\\'re going to end up having rolling blackouts if they kneecap reliable energy production in this country. Florida\\'s had a massive decline in emissions -- wasn\\'t because of a single mandate.</p>\\n<p>It was because of innovation, because a lot of natural gas has replaced coal. We do have market-based solar, and it\\'s a compliment, but we cannot walk away from reliable energy. And I think about, here\\'s what the left wants to do. They want to take away your freedom, and they want you to pay more for everything.</p>\\n<p>We need you to pay less for energy. And we need to make sure people can innovate. We cannot have these mandates and they\\'ll be gone the day I\\'m President.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, Governor, just a point of clarification -- 15 seconds. A recent research at the University of Iowa ties these floods in Iowa to the rise in greenhouse gases.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And here\\'s the thing, Jake, I appreciate that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Let me just ask the question. As President, would you do anything to deal with this underlying cause?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Innovate, and here\\'s the thing. China is building two coal plants a week. You can do everything Biden wants to do and you\\'re going to have way more of what China\\'s increasing it. So, why would we be cutting off our nose to spite our face? China is the problem here, and so hold them accountable.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But don\\'t hold the American people to less opportunity.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley, as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause of the floods and other climate disasters, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, first of all, regardless of what party, everybody wants to have clean air, clean water. They want a world that they can pass on to their kids that\\'s going to be healthy and all of that. But it\\'s how do we do that? I think the first thing we have to understand is you don\\'t deal in extremes.</p>\\n<p>When I was at the United Nations, the reason I took us out of the Paris climate agreement was because President Obama had put all these mandates down on our businesses, but they didn\\'t do anything to hold China and India to account. Those are the two countries we have to really go to if we care about the environment, that we go and make them be held accountable.</p>\\n<p>The second thing is we\\'ll roll back all of Biden\\'s green subsidies because they\\'re misplaced. Rather than putting anything towards innovation on what we can do on nuclear fusion and other things that reduce emissions, which there are things out there, to go and have everybody have to drive an electric car by 2035. That\\'s not even smart. One, because which, by the way, Ron took Biden\\'s stimulus money and did charging stations all throughout Florida. I wouldn\\'t have taken the stimulus money. But what that does is basically, we don\\'t have the infrastructure. And I\\'m not just talking about charging stations. Electric vehicles are heavy. Our roads and bridges wouldn\\'t be able to handle that if we did that because they\\'re heavy in weight.</p>\\n<p>And so we have to be smart about the way we do that. Not to mention 70 percent of the batteries in electric cars are made in China. So, Biden gave this massive windfall to our number one national security threat. If we\\'re going to do it, innovate it, transition and do it the right way, not in extremes.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. I want to turn to the issue of crime. The majority of Americans describe crime in the U.S. as either extremely or very serious. Recent data show crime rates falling, but some violent crime rates do remain high. Governor Haley, former President Trump, suggested that he might try to stop violent crime by deploying U.S. troops to democratic-run states and cities, something he could potentially do under the Insurrection Act. Is that something that you would do as President?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> What I would do is, first of all, defund sanctuary cities. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. That\\'s where we\\'re seeing a lot of crime. But the second thing is, our law enforcement is demoralized right now. Because if they go and they arrest someone for having a stolen gun, it\\'s demoralizing when they go through all that effort, put their lives at risk, and then you turn around and let that criminal go the very next day.</p>\\n<p>Prosecutors need to prosecute according to the law and we\\'ve got to start holding them accountable. When we bring law and order back to our cities, then that\\'s when they\\'ll be safe. You don\\'t do it by defunding the police, and you don\\'t do it by just praising the police.</p>\\n<p>You do it by having their backs, making sure we pass the first Body Camera Bill in the country in South Carolina, to make sure that law enforcement felt like they could do their job without anyone -- without feeling threatened about them doing their job.</p>\\n<p>But we have to have prosecutors prosecuting. We have to defund sanctuary cities. We have to get these stolen guns and drugs off the street. And the only way we can do that is when we empower law enforcement.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I just think, I mean, that quote from the President, former president Trump is a little bit rich because he was President during the worst rioting in the modern history of this country, the BLM riots in the summer of 2020. When I saw that happening in Minneapolis, in Florida, I called out the National Guard. We had state law enforcement deployed.</p>\\n<p>We said, you\\'re not burning down our cities in this state. And you know what? It didn\\'t happen. He sat in the White House and tweeted law and order, but he did nothing to ensure law and order. As your President, I will never let our cities burn. You have every right to stop this runaway rioting as President. In fact, you have a duty.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley and I have a disagreement on the BLM stuff, too, because she tweeted during this period of time that the death of George Floyd should be, quote, \"personal and painful for each and every American\".</p>\\n<p>But people in Iowa had nothing to do with that, or Florida or South Carolina, she was virtue signaling to the left, she was accepting the narrative, and she was trying to impress people who were never going to like us.</p>\\n<p>I never bought in to going after the police, we backed the Blue to the state of Florida, and we\\'re about lower crime as a result of that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s interesting that he did that. He put a tweet that was very similar.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That\\'s not true.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> But let me tell you why I did that. First of all, we had one of the worst racial shootings. We had the shooting of Walter Scott who was shot seven times in the back by a dirty cop. We had a horrific shooting at a church where a white supremacist came in and killed nine amazing souls.</p>\\n<p>BLM, all of that, we never had to deal with riots. We never had to call in the National Guard, Ron, because when we had both of those shootings, we were able to pull people together. We didn\\'t have riots, we had vigils. We didn\\'t have protests, we had prayer. We brought people together.</p>\\n<p>When I said that about George Floyd, when we turned around and had the worst shooting in a religious place that we had seen in this country, not only did I pass the first Body Camera Bill in the country and keep our state together, not only did I move to bring the Confederate flag down, we came together as a state in prayer --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- and we had no division, no riots, no anything.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> We didn\\'t need the National Guard because a leader knows how to bring out the best of the people.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. So, you have been sparring on the campaign trail for months. We\\'ve seen some vicious attack ads going back and forth, and tonight we have had a very lively debate. On a different note, Governor DeSantis, let me ask you, what do you admire about Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, look, I mean, I think that, you know, at the United Nations, I did think that she spoke out strongly on some key issues, and I appreciated that. I also appreciate the state of South Carolina. My wife is a College of Charleston graduate. Her parents lived there for many, many years.</p>\\n<p>And so, it is a wonderful state. There\\'s a lot of great people there. And I think to be able to have been Governor there is a great achievement. And I really appreciate everyone I\\'ve gotten to meet in South Carolina.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, what do you admire about Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think he\\'s been a good governor.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Okay. So, we\\'re going to squeeze in another quick break. And we\\'ll be right back with more from the Republican debates here at Drake University.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re back live from Des Moines, Iowa in the CNN Republican Presidential Debate. We now have time for closing statements and we begin with Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, I want to thank the good people of Iowa. I have campaigned for 11 months, whether it\\'s driving a combine or holding a pig at a produce area or whether it\\'s the fact that we\\'ve met owners of bakeries and small businesses.</p>\\n<p>You know, every one of them knows that we can\\'t go through four more years of chaos. And if it\\'s Donald Trump, there will be four more years of chaos. And we can\\'t be a country in disarray in a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. And we can\\'t go through another nail-biter of an election.</p>\\n<p>And if you look at the polls right now, going against Joe Biden, in every one of those head-to-head polls, Ron doesn\\'t beat Joe Biden. Trump is head-to-head. On a good day, he might be up by two points. I defeat Biden by 17 points. That\\'s bigger than the presidency.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s House, that\\'s Senate, that\\'s governorships, that\\'s down to school board. That\\'s a mandate to get our spending under control and get inflation down. That\\'s a mandate to get our kids reading again and go back to the basics in education. That\\'s a mandate to secure our borders with no more excuses. That\\'s a mandate to bring law and order back to our country and that\\'s a mandate for a strong America that we can be proud of.</p>\\n<p>We can do this. I know we can do this. If you will join with me in this movement, if you join with me in this fight, I promise you our best days are to come. God bless you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, it\\'s been great to visit all 99 counties here in Iowa. I\\'ve been able to meet so many friends and really learn about some of the best of America. Iowa\\'s votes do not need to be corrected by any other state. You all know what you\\'re doing. And we have an opportunity on Monday to really change the course of history.</p>\\n<p>Donald Trump\\'s running for his issues. Nikki Haley\\'s running for her donors\\' issues. I\\'m running for your issues, your family\\'s issues, and solely to turn this country around. I\\'m the only one running that\\'s delivered on 100 percent of my promises. And I\\'m the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again, from the teachers\\' unions, to Fauci, to the Democratic Party.</p>\\n<p>We need to run under the banner of bold colors that are putting the American people first. We can\\'t run under a banner of pale pastels of the warmed-over corporatism, the likes of which is practiced by Nikki Haley. Freedom is on the ballot. Decline is a choice. We have it within our power to fix this country and to turn it around.</p>\\n<p>I am asking for your support in the Iowa caucus on Monday, January 15th. I\\'ll be a President that you can be proud of and I promise you this, I will get the job done and I will not let you down. Thank you and God bless you all.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Our thanks to Governor DeSantis and Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis and Governor Haley, thank you so much both of you for being here tonight. Thanks to our audience, to our host, Drake University. For Dana Bash and the whole CNN team, I\\'m Jake Tapper. Thank you so much for watching. Be sure to join us Monday, January 15th at 4 P.M. Eastern for CNN\\'s coverage of the Iowa caucuses. Anderson Cooper and Kaitlan Collins are going to pick it up right now with more on the debate.

It's not just about a sheet of paper if you don't get any good doctors that get you entitled for that.\",\n",
       " 'BASH: Thank you, Governor. Governor DeSantis mentioned mental health. Let\\'s talk about that. There is a mental health crisis in this country. An estimated 58 million Americans suffer from some type of mental health illness. Governor Haley, you say the mental health crisis is a quote, \"cancer that no one has dealt with\". What do you think is causing the crisis and what would you do to fix it?',\n",
       " 'HALEY: Well, I think we saw it exacerbated by COVID. I mean with the school lockdowns and everything else we see young people now with more anxiety, stress and depression than ever before. One in three people right now suffer from mental health issues, but if treated, they can live a perfectly normal life.',\n",
       " \"The problem is we don't have enough mental health therapists. We don't have enough mental health treatment centers. We don't have enough addiction centers. And if you happen to be lucky enough to get one of those three, insurance doesn't cover it.\",\n",

And that's why we need to have more Telehealth, so that people can get the mental health care they need right when they need it. We need to have mental health counselors in schools so they can identify when a child has a problem that they can get the help that they need. But right now, we've got to get access to care. And that's, again, why I want to move those federal programs down to the state level, because states know they need more mental health support.\",\n",
       " \"They're not getting the dollars to do it. We don't need D.C. bureaucrats handling that. We need this on the ground so that we can get the mental health centers, get the therapists, and get the help that people need so that they can be healthy again.\",\n",
       " 'BASH: Governor DeSantis, you said right here in Iowa this summer that closing mental health institutions, a policy supported by Ronald Reagan, was a mistake. As President, would you restore federal funding to those mental health institutions?',\n",
       " 'DESANTIS: Yes, we need more people in institutionalized settings, unfortunately. But, you know, Governor Haley mentioned, I think, correctly, the devastating mental health consequences for these school closures, a lot of things that happened during COVID, I never recalled seeing her out there fighting the fight. I was on the front lines on that. Governor Kim Reynolds was on the front lines on that.',\n",
       " \"We fought back against the biomedical state. We were attacked by the media. We were attacked by the pharmaceutical companies. We were attacked by the left, attacked by Fauci. We stood and we helped people. And Iowa and Florida had the best schools opening in the entire pandemic because we led. That's what you want to do.\",\n",
       " \"Now, in terms of mental health, I've run into veterans here in Iowa, and I think we have a significant problem with veterans, particularly the post-9-11 veterans, and we know the stats on suicide. It's really, really sad. And as a fellow veteran, as President, I have to put that issue on the front burner.\",\n",

If a veteran has post- traumatic stress, you need more than just that. So, we're going to use the VA to link veterans with resources that are throughout our country.\",\n",
       " \"For example, in Florida, we have an organization that trains service dogs to be able to be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. They understand the symptoms, they mitigate it, and you know what? The suicide rate is close to zero as a result of that. We got to think bigger than these bureaucracies, and we've got to be there for our vets and their mental health.\",\n",

And here's the thing, you know, they talk about -- Joe Biden has said that global warming is worse than a nuclear war. And I'm just thinking to myself, well, gee, John Kerry hasn't given up his private jet. Obama hasn't given up his Martha's Vineyard seaside mansion. I haven't seen Biden do anything to hold China accountable except making sure that Hunter gets his money.\",\n",

But I also think that those policies would devastate communities, particularly here in Iowa. I mean, for example, he wants to mandate electric vehicles. That's going to be more costly.\",\n",
       " \"I think the car companies would go bankrupt, but it's going to hurt liquid fuels, which is very, very important. You're going to end up having rolling blackouts if they kneecap reliable energy production in this country. Florida's had a massive decline in emissions -- wasn't because of a single mandate.\",\n",
       " \"It was because of innovation, because a lot of natural gas has replaced coal. We do have market-based solar, and it's a compliment, but we cannot walk away from reliable energy.

They want a world that they can pass on to their kids that's going to be healthy and all of that. But it's how do we do that? I think the first thing we have to understand is you don't deal in extremes.\",\n",
       " \"When I was at the United Nations, the reason I took us out of the Paris climate agreement was because President Obama had put all these mandates down on our businesses, but they didn't do anything to hold China and India to account. Those are the two countries we have to really go to if we care about the environment, that we go and make them be held accountable.\",\n",
       " \"The second thing is we'll roll back all of Biden's green subsidies because they're misplaced. Rather than putting anything towards innovation on what we can do on nuclear fusion and other things that reduce emissions, which there are things out there, to go and have everybody have to drive an electric car by 2035. That's not even smart. One, because which, by the way, Ron took Biden's stimulus money and did charging stations all throughout Florida. I wouldn't have taken the stimulus money. But what that does is basically, we don't have the infrastructure. And I'm not just talking about charging stations. Electric vehicles are heavy. Our roads and bridges wouldn't be able to handle that if we did that because they're heavy in weight.\",\n",
       " \"And so we have to be smart about the way we do that. Not to mention 70 percent of the batteries in electric cars are made in China. So, Biden gave this massive windfall to our number one national security threat. If we're going to do it, innovate it, transition and do it the right way, not in extremes.\",\n",
       " 'BASH: Thank you. I want to turn to the issue of crime. The majority of Americans describe crime in the U.S. as either extremely or very serious. Recent data show crime rates falling, but some violent crime rates do remain high. Governor Haley, former President Trump, suggested that he might try to stop violent crime by deploying U.S. troops to democratic-run states and cities, something he could potentially do under the Insurrection Act. Is that something that you would do as President?',\n",

But the second thing is, our law enforcement is demoralized right now. Because if they go and they arrest someone for having a stolen gun, it's demoralizing when they go through all that effort, put their lives at risk, and then you turn around and let that criminal go the very next day.\",\n",
