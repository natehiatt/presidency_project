       "'Presidential Debate at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri October 9, 2016 PARTICIPANTS: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton (D) and Businessman Donald Trump (R) MODERATORS: Anderson Cooper (CNN) and  Martha Raddatz (ABC News) RADDATZ: Good evening. I’m Martha Raddatz from ABC News. COOPER: And I’m Anderson Cooper from CNN. We want to welcome you to Washington University in St. Louis for the second presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight’s debate is a town hall format, which gives voters a chance to directly ask the candidates questions. Martha and I will ask follow-up questions but the night really belongs to the people in this room, and to people across the country who have submitted questions online.  RADDATZ: The people you see on this stage were chosen by the Gallup Organization. They are all from the St. Louis area and told Gallup they haven’t committed to a candidate. Each of them came here with questions they wanted to ask, and we saw those questions for the first time this morning. Anderson and I and our team from ABC and CNN are the only ones who have seen them. Both candidates will have two minutes to answer each audience and online question. We hope to get to as many questions as we can, so we’ve asked the audience here not to slow things down with any applause. Except for now.  RADDATZ: Ladies and gentlemen the Republican nominee for president, Donald J. Trump, and the Democratic nominee for president, Hillary Clinton. [applause] COOPER: Thank you very much for being here. We’re going to begin with a question from one of the members in our town hall. Each of you will have two minutes to respond to this question. Secretary Clinton, you won the coin toss, so you’ll go first. Our first question comes from Patrice Brock. Patrice? QUESTION: Thank you, and good evening. The last presidential debate could have been rated as MA, mature audiences, per TV parental guidelines. Knowing that educators assign viewing the presidential debates as students’ homework, do you feel you’re modeling appropriate and positive behavior for today’s youth? CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that’s a very good question, because I’ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we’re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That’s why the slogan of my campaign is “Stronger Together,” because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals—and I’ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else. If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there’s nothing in my opinion that America can’t do. So that’s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I’m hoping to earn your vote, I’m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that’s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, thank you. Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. TRUMP: Well, I actually agree with that. I agree with everything she said. I began this campaign because I was so tired of seeing such foolish things happen to our country. This is a great country. This is a great land. I’ve gotten to know the people of the country over the last year-and-a-half that I’ve been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe I’m saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what’s happening with some horrible things like Obamacare, where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it’s a one-sided transaction where we’re giving back $150 billion to a terrorist state, really, the number one terror state, we’ve made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all of the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it’s in business and trade, where we’re doing so badly. Last year, we had an almost $800 billion trade deficit. In other words, trading with other countries. We had an $800 billion deficit. It’s hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say who’s making these deals? We’re going to make great trade deals. We’re going to have a strong border. We’re going to bring back law and order. Just today, policemen was shot, two killed. And this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time, we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that haven’t been done, including fixing and making our inner cities better for the African-American citizens that are so great, and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it. It’s called make America great again. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. The question from Patrice was about are you both modeling positive and appropriate behavior for today’s youth? We received a lot of questions online, Mr. Trump, about the tape that was released on Friday, as you can imagine. You called what you said locker room banter. You described kissing women without consent, grabbing their genitals. That is sexual assault. You bragged that you have sexually assaulted women. Do you understand that? TRUMP: No, I didn’t say that at all. I don’t think you understood what was—this was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I apologize to my family. I apologize to the American people. Certainly, I’m not proud of it. But this is locker room talk. You know, when we have a world where you have ISIS chopping off heads, where you have—and, frankly, drowning people in steel cages, where you have wars and horrible, horrible sights all over, where you have so many bad things happening, this is like medieval times. We haven’t seen anything like this, the carnage all over the world. And they look and they see. Can you imagine the people that are, frankly, doing so well against us with ISIS? And they look at our country and they see what’s going on. Yes, I’m very embarrassed by it. I hate it. But it’s locker room talk, and it’s one of those things. I will knock the hell out of ISIS. We’re going to defeat ISIS. ISIS happened a number of years ago in a vacuum that was left because of bad judgment. And I will tell you, I will take care of ISIS. COOPER: So, Mr. Trump… TRUMP: And we should get on to much more important things and much bigger things. COOPER: Just for the record, though, are you saying that what you said on that bus 11 years ago that you did not actually kiss women without consent or grope women without consent? TRUMP: I have great respect for women. Nobody has more respect for women than I do. COOPER: So, for the record, you’re saying you never did that? TRUMP: I’ve said things that, frankly, you hear these things I said. And I was embarrassed by it. But I have tremendous respect for women. COOPER: Have you ever done those things? TRUMP: And women have respect for me. And I will tell you: No, I have not. And I will tell you that I’m going to make our country safe. We’re going to have borders in our country, which we don’t have now. People are pouring into our country, and they’re coming in from the Middle East and other places. We’re going to make America safe again. We’re going to make America great again, but we’re going to make America safe again. And we’re going to make America wealthy again, because if you don’t do that, it just—it sounds harsh to say, but we have to build up the wealth of our nation. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. TRUMP: Right now, other nations are taking our jobs and they’re taking our wealth. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. TRUMP: And that’s what I want to talk about. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, do you want to respond? CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn’t represent who he is. But I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we’ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We’ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We’ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms. So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it’s not only women, and it’s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That’s why—to go back to your question—I want to send a message—we all should—to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I’m so fortunate enough to become your president. RADDATZ: And we want to get to some questions from online… TRUMP: Am I allowed to respond to that? I assume I am. RADDATZ: Yes, you can respond to that. TRUMP: It’s just words, folks. It’s just words. Those words, I’ve been hearing them for many years. I heard them when they were running for the Senate in New York, where Hillary was going to bring back jobs to upstate New York and she failed. I’ve heard them where Hillary is constantly talking about the inner cities of our country, which are a disaster education-wise, job-wise, safety-wise, in every way possible. I’m going to help the African-Americans. I’m going to help the Latinos, Hispanics. I am going to help the inner cities. She’s done a terrible job for the African-Americans. She wants their vote, and she does nothing, and then she comes back four years later. We saw that firsthand when she was a United States senator. She campaigned where the primary part of her campaign… RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump—I want to get to audience questions and online questions. TRUMP: So, she’s allowed to do that, but I’m not allowed to respond? RADDATZ: You’re going to have—you’re going to get to respond right now. TRUMP: Sounds fair. RADDATZ: This tape is generating intense interest. In just 48 hours, it’s become the single most talked about story of the entire 2016 election on Facebook, with millions and millions of people discussing it on the social network. As we said a moment ago, we do want to bring in questions from voters around country via social media, and our first stays on this topic. Jeff from Ohio asks on Facebook, “Trump says the campaign has changed him. When did that happen?” So, Mr. Trump, let me add to that. When you walked off that bus at age 59, were you a different man or did that behavior continue until just recently? And you have two minutes for this. TRUMP: It was locker room talk, as I told you. That was locker room talk. I’m not proud of it. I am a person who has great respect for people, for my family, for the people of this country. And certainly, I’m not proud of it. But that was something that happened. If you look at Bill Clinton, far worse. Mine are words, and his was action. His was what he’s done to women. There’s never been anybody in the history of politics in this nation that’s been so abusive to women. So you can say any way you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who is a wonderful woman, at 12 years old, was raped at 12. Her client she represented got him off, and she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight. So don’t tell me about words. I am absolutely—I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did, he was impeached, he lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women. Paula Jones, who’s also here tonight. And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said 11 years ago, I think it’s disgraceful, and I think she should be ashamed of herself, if you want to know the truth. [applause] RADDATZ: Can we please hold the applause? Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he’s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people’s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that’s his choice. When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high. [applause] And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he’s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion. He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn’t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, “Mexican.” He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words. TRUMP: Well, you owe the president an apology, because as you know very well, your campaign, Sidney Blumenthal—he’s another real winner that you have—and he’s the one that got this started, along with your campaign manager, and they were on television just two weeks ago, she was, saying exactly that. So you really owe him an apology. You’re the one that sent the pictures around your campaign, sent the pictures around with President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama. I’ve gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I’ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So, you talk about friend? Go back and take a look at those commercials, a race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race, where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they said about Bernie Sanders and see what Deborah Wasserman Schultz had in mind, because Bernie Sanders, between super-delegates and Deborah Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. And I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology, I think the one that you should really be apologizing for and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the 33,000 e-mails that you deleted, and that you acid washed, and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were taken from an office and are now missing. And I’ll tell you what. I didn’t think I’d say this, but I’m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation, because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it, and we’re going to have a special prosecutor. When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this, where e-mails—and you get a subpoena, you get a subpoena, and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails, and then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say, very expensive process. So we’re going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it, because you know what? People have been—their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you’ve done. And it’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, I want to follow up on that. [crosstalk] RADDATZ: I’m going to let you talk about e-mails. CLINTON: … because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I’m not surprised. TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: In the first debate…[laughter] RADDATZ: And really, the audience needs to calm down here. CLINTON: … I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I’d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we’re going to really make lives better for people. So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump—you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we’ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is—it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country. TRUMP: Because you’d be in jail. [applause] RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton… COOPER: We want to remind the audience to please not talk out loud. Please do not applaud. You’re just wasting time. RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, I do want to follow up on e- mails. You’ve said your handing of your e-mails was a mistake. You disagreed with FBI Director James Comey, calling your handling of classified information, quote, “extremely careless.” The FBI said that there were 110 classified e-mails that were exchanged, eight of which were top secret, and that it was possible hostile actors did gain access to those e-mails. You don’t call that extremely careless? CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say—and I’ve said before, but I’ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it—that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I’m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that. But I think it’s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all—anyone who says otherwise has no basis—that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands. I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after Bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands. RADDATZ: OK, we’re going to move on. TRUMP: And yet she didn’t know the word—the letter C on a document. Right? She didn’t even know what that word—what that letter meant. You know, it’s amazing. I’m watching Hillary go over facts. And she’s going after fact after fact, and she’s lying again, because she said she—you know, what she did with the e-mails was fine. You think it was fine to delete 33,000 e-mails? I don’t think so. She said the 33,000 e-mails had to do with her daughter’s wedding, number one, and a yoga class. Well, maybe we’ll give three or three or four or five or something. 33,000 e-mails deleted, and now she’s saying there wasn’t anything wrong. And more importantly, that was after getting a subpoena. That wasn’t before. That was after. She got it from the United States Congress. And I’ll be honest, I am so disappointed in congressmen, including Republicans, for allowing this to happen. Our Justice Department, where her husband goes onto the back of an airplane for 39 minutes, talks to the attorney general days before a ruling is going to be made on her case. But for you to say that there was nothing wrong with you deleting 39,000 e-mails, again, you should be ashamed of yourself. What you did—and this is after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. COOPER: We have to move on. TRUMP: You did that. Wait a minute. One second. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond, and then we’ve got to move on. RADDATZ: We want to give the audience a chance. TRUMP: If you did that in the private sector, you’d be put in jail, let alone after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you can respond. Then we have to move on to an audience question. CLINTON: Look, it’s just not true. And so please, go to… TRUMP: Oh, you didn’t delete them? COOPER: Allow her to respond, please. CLINTON: It was personal e-mails, not official. TRUMP: Oh, 33,000? Yeah. CLINTON: Not—well, we turned over 35,000, so… TRUMP: Oh, yeah. What about the other 15,000? COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn’t talk while you talked. CLINTON: Yes, that’s true, I didn’t. TRUMP: Because you have nothing to say. CLINTON: I didn’t in the first debate, and I’m going to try not to in this debate, because I’d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about. TRUMP: And get off this question. CLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you’re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let’s at least focus… TRUMP: Let’s see what happens…[crosstalk] COOPER: Allow her to respond. CLINTON: … on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let’s get to their questions. COOPER: We have a question here from Ken Karpowicz. He has a question about health care. Ken? TRUMP: I’d like to know, Anderson, why aren’t you bringing up the e-mails? I’d like to know. Why aren’t you bringing… COOPER: We brought up the e-mails. TRUMP: No, it hasn’t. It hasn’t. And it hasn’t been finished at all. COOPER: Ken Karpowicz has a question. TRUMP: It’s nice to—one on three. QUESTION: Thank you. Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, it is not affordable. Premiums have gone up. Deductibles have gone up. Copays have gone up. Prescriptions have gone up. And the coverage has gone down. What will you do to bring the cost down and make coverage better? COOPER: That first one goes to Secretary Clinton, because you started out the last one to the audience. CLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald. TRUMP: No, I’m a gentleman, Hillary. Go ahead. [laughter] COOPER: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he’s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I’ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here’s what I don’t want people to forget when we’re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn’t just that 20 million people got insurance who didn’t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can’t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can’t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you’re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn’t happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we’ve got to get costs down. We’ve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That’s the highest we’ve ever been in our country. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your time is up. CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up. COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. TRUMP: It is such a great question and it’s maybe the question I get almost more than anything else, outside of defense. Obamacare is a disaster. You know it. We all know it. It’s going up at numbers that nobody’s ever seen worldwide. Nobody’s ever seen numbers like this for health care. It’s only getting worse. In ’17, it implodes by itself. Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money, more and more money. We have right now almost $20 trillion in debt. Obamacare will never work. It’s very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive. And not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It’s going to be one of the biggest line items very shortly. We have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive and something that works, where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines, where we stop insurance companies from coming in and competing, because they want—and President Obama and whoever was working on it—they want to leave those lines, because that gives the insurance companies essentially monopolies. We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster, somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven’t noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, when something happens, they come into the United States in many cases because their system is so slow. It’s catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single payer, which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that nobody’s ever believed, but your deductibles are going up, so that unless you get hit by a truck, you’re never going to be able to use it. COOPER: Mr. Trump, your time… TRUMP: It is a disastrous plan, and it has to be repealed and replaced. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, let me follow up with you. Your husband called Obamacare, quote, “the craziest thing in the world,” saying that small-business owners are getting killed as premiums double, coverage is cut in half. Was he mistaken or was the mistake simply telling the truth? CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it’s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That’s where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn’t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn’t have the money to afford insurance and didn’t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald’s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies… COOPER: Secretary Clinton… CLINTON: … get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma… COOPER: Your time is up. CLINTON: … you may not be able to have insurance because you can’t afford it. So let’s fix what’s broken about it, but let’s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That’s not going to work. COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up on this. TRUMP: Well, I just want—just one thing. First of all, Hillary, everything’s broken about it. Everything. Number two, Bernie Sanders said that Hillary Clinton has very bad judgment. This is a perfect example of it, trying to save Obamacare, which is a disaster. COOPER: You’ve said you want to end Obamacare… TRUMP: By the way… COOPER: You’ve said you want to end Obamacare. You’ve also said you want to make coverage accessible for people with pre-existing conditions. How do you force insurance companies to do that if you’re no longer mandating that every American get insurance? TRUMP: We’re going to be able to. You’re going to have plans… COOPER: What does that mean? TRUMP: Well, I’ll tell you what it means. You’re going to have plans that are so good, because we’re going to have so much competition in the insurance industry. Once we break out—once we break out the lines and allow the competition to come… COOPER: Are you going—are you going to have a mandate that Americans have to have health insurance? TRUMP: President Obama—Anderson, excuse me. President Obama, by keeping those lines, the boundary lines around each state, it was almost gone until just very toward the end of the passage of Obamacare, which, by the way, was a fraud. You know that, because Jonathan Gruber, the architect of Obamacare, was said—he said it was a great lie, it was a big lie. President Obama said you keep your doctor, you keep your plan. The whole thing was a fraud, and it doesn’t work. But when we get rid of those lines, you will have competition, and we will be able to keep pre-existing, we’ll also be able to help people that can’t get—don’t have money because we are going to have people protected. And Republicans feel this way, believe it or not, and strongly this way. We’re going to block grant into the states. We’re going to block grant into Medicaid into the states… COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. TRUMP: … so that we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves. COOPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. RADDATZ: We now go to Gorbah Hamed with a question for both candidates. QUESTION: Hi. There are 3.3 million Muslims in the United States, and I’m one of them. You’ve mentioned working with Muslim nations, but with Islamophobia on the rise, how will you help people like me deal with the consequences of being labeled as a threat to the country after the election is over? RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, you’re first. TRUMP: Well, you’re right about Islamophobia, and that’s a shame. But one thing we have to do is we have to make sure that—because there is a problem. I mean, whether we like it or not, and we could be very politically correct, but whether we like it or not, there is a problem. And we have to be sure that Muslims come in and report when they see something going on. When they see hatred going on, they have to report it. As an example, in San Bernardino, many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14 and wounded many, many people. Horribly wounded. They’ll never be the same. Muslims have to report the problems when they see them. And, you know, there’s always a reason for everything. If they don’t do that, it’s a very difficult situation for our country, because you look at Orlando and you look at San Bernardino and you look at the World Trade Center. Go outside. Look at Paris. Look at that horrible—these are radical Islamic terrorists. And she won’t even mention the word and nor will President Obama. He won’t use the term “radical Islamic terrorism.” Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won’t say the name and President Obama won’t say the name. But the name is there. It’s radical Islamic terror. And before you solve it, you have to say the name. RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton? CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I’ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. I want to say just a couple of things. First, we’ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we’ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particularly well-known one with Muhammad Ali. My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you’re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That’s what America is. That’s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren. It’s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I’ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I’ve met with a lot of them, and I’ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that’s what I want to see. It’s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else. RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump, in December, you said this. “Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on. We have no choice. We have no choice.” Your running mate said this week that the Muslim ban is no longer your position. Is that correct? And if it is, was it a mistake to have a religious test? TRUMP: First of all, Captain Khan is an American hero, and if I were president at that time, he would be alive today, because unlike her, who voted for the war without knowing what she was doing, I would not have had our people in Iraq. Iraq was a disaster. So he would have been alive today. The Muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into a extreme vetting from certain areas of the world. Hillary Clinton wants to allow hundreds of thousands—excuse me. Excuse me.. RADDATZ: And why did it morph into that? No, did you—no, answer the question. Do you still believe… TRUMP: Why don’t you interrupt her? You interrupt me all the time. RADDATZ: I do. TRUMP: Why don’t you interrupt her? RADDATZ: Would you please explain whether or not the Muslim ban still stands? TRUMP: It’s called extreme vetting. We are going to areas like Syria where they’re coming in by the tens of thousands because of Barack Obama. And Hillary Clinton wants to allow a 550 percent increase over Obama. People are coming into our country like we have no idea who they are, where they are from, what their feelings about our country is, and she wants 550 percent more. This is going to be the great Trojan horse of all time. We have enough problems in this country. I believe in building safe zones. I believe in having other people pay for them, as an example, the Gulf states, who are not carrying their weight, but they have nothing but money, and take care of people. But I don’t want to have, with all the problems this country has and all of the problems that you see going on, hundreds of thousands of people coming in from Syria when we know nothing about them. We know nothing about their values and we know nothing about their love for our country. RADDATZ: And, Secretary Clinton, let me ask you about that, because you have asked for an increase from 10,000 to 65,000 Syrian refugees. We know you want tougher vetting. That’s not a perfect system. So why take the risk of having those refugees come into the country? CLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children—think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he’d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those? So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he’s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It’s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say. TRUMP: That’s not been debunked. CLINTON: So, please… TRUMP: That has not been debunked. CLINTON: … go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it. TRUMP: I was against—I was against the war in Iraq. Has not been debunked. And you voted for it. And you shouldn’t have. Well, I just want to say… RADDATZ: There’s been lots of fact-checking on that. I’d like to move on to an online question… TRUMP: Excuse me. She just went about 25 seconds over her time. RADDATZ: She did not. TRUMP: Could I just respond to this, please? RADDATZ: Very quickly, please. TRUMP: Hillary Clinton, in terms of having people come into our country, we have many criminal illegal aliens. When we want to send them back to their country, their country says we don’t want them. In some cases, they’re murderers, drug lords, drug problems. And they don’t want them. And Hillary Clinton, when she was secretary of state, said that’s OK, we can’t force it into their country. Let me tell you, I’m going to force them right back into their country. They’re murderers and some very bad people. And I will tell you very strongly, when Bernie Sanders said she had bad judgment, she has really bad judgment, because we are letting people into this country that are going to cause problems and crime like you’ve never seen. We’re also letting drugs pour through our southern border at a record clip. At a record clip. And it shouldn’t be allowed to happen. ICE just endorsed me. They’ve never endorsed a presidential candidate. The Border Patrol agents, 16,500, just recently endorsed me, and they endorsed me because I understand the border. She doesn’t. She wants amnesty for everybody. Come right in. Come right over. It’s a horrible thing she’s doing. She’s got bad judgment, and honestly, so bad that she should never be president of the United States. That I can tell you. RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. I want to move on. This next question comes from the public through the Bipartisan Open Debate Coalition’s online forum, where Americans submitted questions that generated millions of votes. This question involves WikiLeaks release of purported excerpts of Secretary Clinton’s paid speeches, which she has refused to release, and one line in particular, in which you, Secretary Clinton, purportedly say you need both a public and private position on certain issues. So, Tu, from Virginia asks, is it OK for politicians to be two-faced? Is it acceptable for a politician to have a private stance on issues? Secretary Clinton, your two minutes. CLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called “Lincoln.” It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic. And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great—I thought a great display of presidential leadership. But, you know, let’s talk about what’s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don’t even know if it’s accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. They’re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don’t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has… RADDATZ: We’re going to get to that later. Secretary Clinton, you’re out of time. CLINTON: … with the Russians and other foreign powers. RADDATZ: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Well, I think I should respond, because—so ridiculous. Look, now she’s blaming—she got caught in a total lie. Her papers went out to all her friends at the banks, Goldman Sachs and everybody else, and she said things—WikiLeaks that just came out. And she lied. Now she’s blaming the lie on the late, great Abraham Lincoln. That’s one that I haven’t…[laughter] OK, Honest Abe, Honest Abe never lied. That’s the good thing. That’s the big difference between Abraham Lincoln and you. That’s a big, big difference. We’re talking about some difference. But as far as other elements of what she was saying, I don’t know Putin. I think it would be great if we got along with Russia because we could fight ISIS together, as an example. But I don’t know Putin. But I notice, anytime anything wrong happens, they like to say the Russians are—she doesn’t know if it’s the Russians doing the hacking. Maybe there is no hacking. But they always blame Russia. And the reason they blame Russia because they think they’re trying to tarnish me with Russia. I know nothing about Russia. I know—I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don’t deal there. I have no businesses there. I have no loans from Russia. I have a very, very great balance sheet, so great that when I did the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue, the United States government, because of my balance sheet, which they actually know very well, chose me to do the Old Post Office, between the White House and Congress, chose me to do the Old Post Office. One of the primary things, in fact, perhaps the primary thing was balance sheet. But I have no loans with Russia. You could go to the United States government, and they would probably tell you that, because they know my sheet very well in order to get that development I had to have. Now, the taxes are a very simple thing. As soon as I have—first of all, I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. Many of her friends took bigger deductions. Warren Buffett took a massive deduction. Soros, who’s a friend of hers, took a massive deduction. Many of the people that are giving her all this money that she can do many more commercials than me gave her—took massive deductions. I pay hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes. But—but as soon as my routine audit is finished, I’ll release my returns. I’ll be very proud to. They’re actually quite great. RADDATZ: Thank you, Mr. Trump. COOPER: We want to turn, actually, to the topic of taxes. We have a question from Spencer Maass. Spencer? QUESTION: Good evening. My question is, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share in taxes? COOPER: Mr. Trump, you have two minutes. TRUMP: Well, one thing I’d do is get rid of carried interest. One of the greatest provisions for people like me, to be honest with you, I give up a lot when I run, because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She’s a United States—she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax code. Well, why didn’t she change it? Why didn’t you change it when you were a senator? The reason you didn’t is that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. And I do. You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn’t change it, because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But—and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I’ve heard Hillary complaining about so many different things over the years. “I wish you would have done this.” But she’s been there for 30 years she’s been doing this stuff. She never changed. And she never will change. She never will change. We’re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I’m lowering taxes actually, because I think it’s so important for corporations, because we have corporations leaving—massive corporations and little ones, little ones can’t form. We’re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we’re bringing the tax rate down from 35 percent to 15 percent. We’re cutting taxes for the middle class. And I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you, Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me. She’s raising your taxes really high. And what that’s going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes and I’m lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There’s no growth. If China has a GDP of 7 percent, it’s like a national catastrophe. We’re down at 1 percent. And that’s, like, no growth. And we’re going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high, just about the highest in the world. And I’m bringing them down to one of the lower in the world. And I think it’s so important—one of the most important things we can do. But she is raising everybody’s taxes massively. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, you have two minutes. The question was, what specific tax provisions will you change to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share of taxes? CLINTON: Well, everything you’ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I’m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn’t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he’s going to do. But I’ll tell you what he’s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, here’s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year—and that’s the vast majority of Americans as you know—will have their taxes raised, because I think we’ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It’s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who’s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it’s been unfortunate, but it’s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong. COOPER: Thank you, Secretary. CLINTON: And we’re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country. COOPER: Thank you. I want to give you—Mr. Trump, I want to give you the chance to respond. I just wanted to tell our viewers what she’s referring to. In the last month, taxes were the number-one issue on Facebook for the first time in the campaign. The New York Times published three pages of your 1995 tax returns. They show you claimed a $916 million loss, which means you could have avoided paying personal federal income taxes for years. You’ve said you pay state taxes, employee taxes, real estate taxes, property taxes. You have not answered, though, a simple question. Did you use that $916 million loss to avoid paying personal federal income taxes for years? TRUMP: Of course I do. Of course I do. And so do all of her donors, or most of her donors. I know many of her donors. Her donors took massive tax write-offs. COOPER: So have you paid personal federal income tax? TRUMP: A lot of my—excuse me, Anderson—a lot of my write- off was depreciation and other things that Hillary as a senator allowed. And she’ll always allow it, because the people that give her all this money, they want it. That’s why. See, I understand the tax code better than anybody that’s ever run for president. Hillary Clinton—and it’s extremely complex—Hillary Clinton has friends that want all of these provisions, including they want the carried interest provision, which is very important to Wall Street people. But they really want the carried interest provision, which I believe Hillary’s leaving. Very interesting why she’s leaving carried interest. But I will tell you that, number one, I pay tremendous numbers of taxes. I absolutely used it. And so did Warren Buffett and so did George Soros and so did many of the other people that Hillary is getting money from. Now, I won’t mention their names, because they’re rich, but they’re not famous. So we won’t make them famous. COOPER: So can you—can you say how many years you have avoided paying personal federal income taxes? TRUMP: No, but I pay tax, and I pay federal tax, too. But I have a write-off, a lot of it’s depreciation, which is a wonderful charge. I love depreciation. You know, she’s given it to us. Hey, if she had a problem—for 30 years she’s been doing this, Anderson. I say it all the time. She talks about health care. Why didn’t she do something about it? She talks about taxes. Why didn’t she do something about it? She doesn’t do anything about anything other than talk. With her, it’s all talk and no action.  COOPER: In the past… TRUMP: And, again, Bernie Sanders, it’s really bad judgment. She has made bad judgment not only on taxes. She’s made bad judgments on Libya, on Syria, on Iraq. I mean, her and Obama, whether you like it or not, the way they got out of Iraq, the vacuum they’ve left, that’s why ISIS formed in the first place. They started from that little area, and now they’re in 32 different nations, Hillary. Congratulations. Great job. COOPER: Secretary—I want you to be able to respond, Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: Well, here we go again. I’ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that’s not the point here. TRUMP: Why didn’t you do it? Why didn’t you do it? COOPER: Allow her to respond. CLINTON: Because I was a senator with a Republican president. TRUMP: Oh, really? CLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That’s exactly right. TRUMP: You could have done it, if you were an effective—if you were an effective senator, you could have done it. If you were an effective senator, you could have done it. But you were not an effective senator. COOPER: Please allow her to respond. She didn’t interrupt you. CLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, “30 years this and 30 years that.” So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I’m very glad to do so. Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done. When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women’s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington. COOPER: Thank you, secretary. CLINTON: And I’ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I’ve produced results for people. COOPER: Thank you, secretary. RADDATZ: We’re going to move on to Syria. Both of you have mentioned that. TRUMP: She said a lot of things that were false. I mean, I think we should be allowed to maybe… RADDATZ: No, we can—no, Mr. Trump, we’re going to go on. This is about the audience. TRUMP: Excuse me. Because she has been a disaster as a senator. A disaster. RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we’re going to move on. The heart-breaking video of a 5-year-old Syrian boy named Omran sitting in an ambulance after being pulled from the rubble after an air strike in Aleppo focused the world’s attention on the horrors of the war in Syria, with 136 million views on Facebook alone. But there are much worse images coming out of Aleppo every day now, where in the past few weeks alone, 400 people have been killed, at least 100 of them children. Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its ally, Russia, for their bombardment of Aleppo. So this next question comes from social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asks, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? Isn’t it a lot like the Holocaust when the U.S. waited too long before we helped? Secretary Clinton, we will begin with your two minutes. CLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn’t paid any attention to ISIS. They’re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it’s all in, in Syria. And they’ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it’s not me. I’ve stood up to Russia. I’ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that’s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It’s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable. RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Mr. Trump? TRUMP: First of all, she was there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand, which… CLINTON: No, I wasn’t. I was gone. I hate to interrupt you, but at some point… TRUMP: OK. But you were in contact—excuse me. You were… CLINTON: At some point, we need to do some fact-checking here. TRUMP: You were in total contact with the White House, and perhaps, sadly, Obama probably still listened to you. I don’t think he would be listening to you very much anymore. Obama draws the line in the sand. It was laughed at all over the world what happened. Now, with that being said, she talks tough against Russia. But our nuclear program has fallen way behind, and they’ve gone wild with their nuclear program. Not good. Our government shouldn’t have allowed that to happen. Russia is new in terms of nuclear. We are old. We’re tired. We’re exhausted in terms of nuclear. A very bad thing. Now, she talks tough, she talks really tough against Putin and against Assad. She talks in favor of the rebels. She doesn’t even know who the rebels are. You know, every time we take rebels, whether it’s in Iraq or anywhere else, we’re arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look at what she did in Libya with Gadhafi. Gadhafi’s out. It’s a mess. And, by the way, ISIS has a good chunk of their oil. I’m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is, almost everything she’s done in foreign policy has been a mistake and it’s been a disaster. But if you look at Russia, just take a look at Russia, and look at what they did this week, where I agree, she wasn’t there, but possibly she’s consulted. We sign a peace treaty. Everyone’s all excited. Well, what Russia did with Assad and, by the way, with Iran, who you made very powerful with the dumbest deal perhaps I’ve ever seen in the history of deal-making, the Iran deal, with the $150 billion, with the $1.7 billion in cash, which is enough cash to fill up this room. But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight. She wants to fight for rebels. There’s only one problem. You don’t even know who the rebels are. So what’s the purpose? RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump, your two minutes is up. TRUMP: And one thing I have to say. RADDATZ: Your two minutes is up. TRUMP: I don’t like Assad at all, but Assad is killing ISIS. Russia is killing ISIS. And Iran is killing ISIS. And those three have now lined up because of our weak foreign policy. RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, let me repeat the question. If you were president…[laughter]…what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo? And I want to remind you what your running mate said. He said provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength and that if Russia continues to be involved in air strikes along with the Syrian government forces of Assad, the United States of America should be prepared to use military force to strike the military targets of the Assad regime. TRUMP: OK. He and I haven’t spoken, and I disagree. I disagree. RADDATZ: You disagree with your running mate? TRUMP: I think you have to knock out ISIS. Right now, Syria is fighting ISIS. We have people that want to fight both at the same time. But Syria is no longer Syria. Syria is Russia and it’s Iran, who she made strong and Kerry and Obama made into a very powerful nation and a very rich nation, very, very quickly, very, very quickly. I believe we have to get ISIS. We have to worry about ISIS before we can get too much more involved. She had a chance to do something with Syria. They had a chance. And that was the line. And she didn’t. RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if Aleppo falls? TRUMP: I think Aleppo is a disaster, humanitarian-wise. RADDATZ: What do you think will happen if it falls? TRUMP: I think that it basically has fallen. OK? It basically has fallen. Let me tell you something. You take a look at Mosul. The biggest problem I have with the stupidity of our foreign policy, we have Mosul. They think a lot of the ISIS leaders are in Mosul. So we have announcements coming out of Washington and coming out of Iraq, we will be attacking Mosul in three weeks or four weeks. Well, all of these bad leaders from ISIS are leaving Mosul. Why can’t they do it quietly? Why can’t they do the attack, make it a sneak attack, and after the attack is made, inform the American public that we’ve knocked out the leaders, we’ve had a tremendous success? People leave. Why do they have to say we’re going to be attacking Mosul within the next four to six weeks, which is what they’re saying? How stupid is our country? RADDATZ: There are sometimes reasons the military does that. Psychological warfare. TRUMP: I can’t think of any. I can’t think of any. And I’m pretty good at it. RADDATZ: It might be to help get civilians out. TRUMP: And we have General Flynn. And we have—look, I have 200 generals and admirals who endorsed me. I have 21 Congressional Medal of Honor recipients who endorsed me. We talk about it all the time. They understand, why can’t they do something secretively, where they go in and they knock out the leadership? How—why would these people stay there? I’ve been reading now… RADDATZ: Tell me what your strategy is. TRUMP: … for weeks—I’ve been reading now for weeks about Mosul, that it’s the harbor of where—you know, between Raqqa and Mosul, this is where they think the ISIS leaders are. Why would they be saying—they’re not staying there anymore. They’re gone. Because everybody’s talking about how Iraq, which is us with our leadership, goes in to fight Mosul. Now, with these 200 admirals and generals, they can’t believe it. All I say is this. General George Patton, General Douglas MacArthur are spinning in their grave at the stupidity of what we’re doing in the Middle East. RADDATZ: I’m going to go to Secretary Clinton. Secretary Clinton, you want Assad to go. You advocated arming rebels, but it looks like that may be too late for Aleppo. You talk about diplomatic efforts. Those have failed. Cease-fires have failed. Would you introduce the threat of U.S. military force beyond a no-fly zone against the Assad regime to back up diplomacy? CLINTON: I would not use American ground forces in Syria. I think that would be a very serious mistake. I don’t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don’t think that is a smart strategy. I do think the use of special forces, which we’re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just… RADDATZ: But what would you do differently than President Obama is doing? CLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I—if I’m fortunate… TRUMP: Everything. CLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn’t. There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation. I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders—and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones—made a difference. So I think that could help. I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there’s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq. RADDATZ: Thank you very much. We’re going to move on… TRUMP: You know what’s funny? She went over a minute over, and you don’t stop her. When I go one second over, it’s like a big deal. RADDATZ: You had many answers. TRUMP: It’s really—it’s really very interesting. COOPER: We’ve got a question over here from James Carter. Mr. Carter? QUESTION: My question is, do you believe you can be a devoted president to all the people in the United States? COOPER: That question begins for Mr. Trump. TRUMP: Absolutely. I mean, she calls our people deplorable, a large group, and irredeemable. I will be a president for all of our people. And I’ll be a president that will turn our inner cities around and will give strength to people and will give economics to people and will bring jobs back. Because NAFTA, signed by her husband, is perhaps the greatest disaster trade deal in the history of the world. Not in this country. It stripped us of manufacturing jobs. We lost our jobs. We lost our money. We lost our plants. It is a disaster. And now she wants to sign TPP, even though she says now she’s for it. She called it the gold standard. And by the way, at the last debate, she lied, because it turned out that she did say the gold standard and she said she didn’t say it. They actually said that she lied. OK? And she lied. But she’s lied about a lot of things. I would be a president for all of the people, African-Americans, the inner cities. Devastating what’s happening to our inner cities. She’s been talking about it for years. As usual, she talks about it, nothing happens. She doesn’t get it done. Same with the Latino Americans, the Hispanic Americans. The same exact thing. They talk, they don’t get it done. You go into the inner cities and—you see it’s 45 percent poverty. African- Americans now 45 percent poverty in the inner cities. The education is a disaster. Jobs are essentially nonexistent. I mean, it’s—you know, and I’ve been saying at big speeches where I have 20,000 and 30,000 people, what do you have to lose? It can’t get any worse. And she’s been talking about the inner cities for 25 years. Nothing’s going to ever happen. Let me tell you, if she’s president of the United States, nothing’s going to happen. It’s just going to be talk. And all of her friends, the taxes we were talking about, and I would just get it by osmosis. She’s not doing any me favors. But by doing all the others’ favors, she’s doing me favors. COOPER: Mr. Trump, thank you. TRUMP: But I will tell you, she’s all talk. It doesn’t get done. All you have to do is take a look at her Senate run. Take a look at upstate New York. COOPER: Your two minutes is up. Secretary Clinton, two minutes? TRUMP: It turned out to be a disaster. COOPER: You have two minutes, Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that. Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I’ve been in public service. I’m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos—one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that every American feels like he or she has a place in our country. And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn’t have a place in Donald Trump’s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He’s 10 years old now. This is the only country he’s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected? You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there’s a lot of fear—in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns. So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody. COOPER: Your time, Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: Democrats, Republicans, independents, people across our country. If you don’t vote for me, I still want to be your president. COOPER: Your two minutes is up. CLINTON: I want to be the best president I can be for every American. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, your two minutes is up. I want to follow up on something that Donald Trump actually said to you, a comment you made last month. You said that half of Donald Trump’s supporters are, quote, “deplorables, racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic.” You later said you regretted saying half. You didn’t express regret for using the term “deplorables.” To Mr. Carter’s question, how can you unite a country if you’ve written off tens of millions of Americans? CLINTON: Well, within hours I said that I was sorry about the way I talked about that, because my argument is not with his supporters. It’s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans. And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he’s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said—I’m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent. COOPER: Thank you. CLINTON: Because we talked about what we wanted to do. We might have had some differences, and we had a lot of debates… COOPER: Thank you, Secretary. TRUMP: … but we believed that we could make the country better. And I was proud of that. COOPER: I want to give you a minute to respond. TRUMP: We have a divided nation. We have a very divided nation. You look at Charlotte. You look at Baltimore. You look at the violence that’s taking place in the inner cities, Chicago, you take a look at Washington, D.C. We have a increase in murder within our cities, the biggest in 45 years. We have a divided nation, because people like her—and believe me, she has tremendous hate in her heart. And when she said deplorables, she meant it. And when she said irredeemable, they’re irredeemable, you didn’t mention that, but when she said they’re irredeemable, to me that might have been even worse. COOPER: She said some of them are irredeemable. TRUMP: She’s got tremendous—she’s got tremendous hatred. And this country cannot take another four years of Barack Obama, and that’s what you’re getting with her. COOPER: Mr. Trump, let me follow up with you. In 2008, you wrote in one of your books that the most important characteristic of a good leader is discipline. You said, if a leader doesn’t have it, quote, “he or she won’t be one for very long.” In the days after the first debate, you sent out a series of tweets from 3 a.m. to 5 a.m., including one that told people to check out a sex tape. Is that the discipline of a good leader? TRUMP: No, there wasn’t check out a sex tape. It was just take a look at the person that she built up to be this wonderful Girl Scout who was no Girl Scout. COOPER: You mentioned sex tape. TRUMP: By the way, just so you understand, when she said 3 o’clock in the morning, take a look at Benghazi. She said who is going to answer the call at 3 o’clock in the morning? Guess what? She didn’t answer it, because when Ambassador Stevens… COOPER: The question is, is that the discipline of a good leader? TRUMP: … 600—wait a minute, Anderson, 600 times. Well, she said she was awake at 3 o’clock in the morning, and she also sent a tweet out at 3 o’clock in the morning, but I won’t even mention that. But she said she’ll be awake. Who’s going—the famous thing, we’re going to answer our call at 3 o’clock in the morning. Guess what happened? Ambassador Stevens—Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help. And the only one she talked to was Sidney Blumenthal, who’s her friend and not a good guy, by the way. So, you know, she shouldn’t be talking about that. Now, tweeting happens to be a modern day form of communication. I mean, you can like it or not like it. I have, between Facebook and Twitter, I have almost 25 million people. It’s a very effective way of communication. So you can put it down, but it is a very effective form of communication. I’m not un-proud of it, to be honest with you. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, does Mr. Trump have the discipline to be a good leader? CLINTON: No. TRUMP: I’m shocked to hear that. [laughter] CLINTON: Well, it’s not only my opinion. It’s the opinion of many others, national security experts, Republicans, former Republican members of Congress. But it’s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it’s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent. And it’s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you’ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me. And I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country. COOPER: We have to move along. CLINTON: Nine million people lost their jobs. RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we have to… CLINTON: Five million homes were lost. RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we’re moving on. CLINTON: And $13 trillion in family wealth was wiped out. We are back on the right track. He would send us back into recession with his tax plans that benefit the wealthiest of Americans. RADDATZ: Secretary Clinton, we are moving to an audience question. We’re almost out of time. We have another… TRUMP: We have the slowest growth since 1929. RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, we’re moving to an audience question. TRUMP: It is—our country has the slowest growth and jobs are a disaster. RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, Secretary Clinton, we want to get to the audience. Thank you very much both of you. [laughter] We have another audience question. Beth Miller has a question for both candidates. QUESTION: Good evening. Perhaps the most important aspect of this election is the Supreme Court justice. What would you prioritize as the most important aspect of selecting a Supreme Court justice? RADDATZ: We begin with your two minutes, Secretary Clinton. CLINTON: Thank you. Well, you’re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn’t agree with that. I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don’t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality. Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you’re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they’ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people. RADDATZ: Thank you, Secretary Clinton. Thank you. You’re out of time. Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Justice Scalia, great judge, died recently. And we have a vacancy. I am looking to appoint judges very much in the mold of Justice Scalia. I’m looking for judges—and I’ve actually picked 20 of them so that people would see, highly respected, highly thought of, and actually very beautifully reviewed by just about everybody. But people that will respect the Constitution of the United States. And I think that this is so important. Also, the Second Amendment, which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They’ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for, what it represents. So important to me. Now, Hillary mentioned something about contributions just so you understand. So I will have in my race more than $100 million put in—of my money, meaning I’m not taking all of this big money from all of these different corporations like she’s doing. What I ask is this. So I’m putting in more than—by the time it’s finished, I’ll have more than $100 million invested. Pretty much self-funding mine. We’re raising money for the Republican Party, and we’re doing tremendously on the small donations, $61 average or so. I ask Hillary, why doesn’t—she made $250 million by being in office. She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn’t she funding, not for $100 million, but why don’t you put $10 million or $20 million or $25 million or $30 million into your own campaign? It’s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren’t you putting some money in? You have a lot of it. You’ve made a lot of it because of the fact that you’ve been in office. Made a lot of it while you were secretary of state, actually. So why aren’t you putting money into your own campaign? I’m just curious. CLINTON: Well…[crosstalk] RADDATZ: Thank you very much. We’re going to get on to one more question. CLINTON: The question was about the Supreme Court. And I just want to quickly say, I respect the Second Amendment. But I believe there should be comprehensive background checks, and we should close the gun show loophole, and close the online loophole. COOPER: Thank you. RADDATZ: We have—we have one more question, Mrs. Clinton. CLINTON: We have to save as many lives as we possibly can. COOPER: We have one more question from Ken Bone about energy policy. Ken? QUESTION: What steps will your energy policy take to meet our energy needs, while at the same time remaining environmentally friendly and minimizing job loss for fossil power plant workers? COOPER: Mr. Trump, two minutes?  TRUMP: Absolutely. I think it’s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolutely siege. The EPA, Environmental Protection Agency, is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in buying our—buying so many of our different plants and then re-jiggering the plant so that they can take care of their oil. We are killing—absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now, I’m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, et cetera. But we need much more than wind and solar. And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for 1,000 years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable—we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet. So good. Especially when you have $20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. They’ll be able to compete. They’ll make money. They’ll pay off our national debt. They’ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits, which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what’s happening to steel and the cost of steel and China dumping vast amounts of steel all over the United States, which essentially is killing our steelworkers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible. The EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania and you see what they’re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business. It’s a disgrace. COOPER: Your time is up. Thank you. TRUMP: It’s an absolute disgrace. COOPER: Secretary Clinton, two minutes. CLINTON: And actually—well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That’s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don’t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else. You know, because it sounds like you’re in the business or you’re aware of people in the business—you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that’s an important transition. We’ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind. That’s why I’m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories. I don’t want to walk away from them. So we’ve got to do something for them. COOPER: Secretary Clinton… CLINTON: But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively. COOPER: Your time is up. CLINTON: And that’s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com and look at my entire policy. COOPER: Time is up. We have time for one more… RADDATZ: We have… COOPER: One more audience question. RADDATZ: We’ve sneaked in one more question, and it comes from Karl Becker. QUESTION: Good evening. My question to both of you is, regardless of the current rhetoric, would either of you name one positive thing that you respect in one another? [applause] RADDATZ: Mr. Trump, would you like to go first? CLINTON: Well, I certainly will, because I think that’s a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don’t agree with nearly anything else he says or does, but I do respect that. And I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me. So I believe that this election has become in part so—so conflict-oriented, so intense because there’s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy for not just four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and around the world, from the Supreme Court to energy and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It’s one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had. And that’s why I’ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off of the personal and put it on to what it is I want to do as president. And that’s why I hope people will check on that for themselves so that they can see that, yes, I’ve spent 30 years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families. And I want to take all that experience to the White House and do that every single day. RADDATZ: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Well, I consider her statement about my children to be a very nice compliment. I don’t know if it was meant to be a compliment, but it is a great—I’m very proud of my children. And they’ve done a wonderful job, and they’ve been wonderful, wonderful kids. So I consider that a compliment. I will say this about Hillary. She doesn’t quit. She doesn’t give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She’s a fighter. I disagree with much of what she’s fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn’t quit, and she doesn’t give up. And I consider that to be a very good trait. RADDATZ: Thanks to both of you. COOPER: We want to thank both the candidates. We want to thank the university here. This concludes the town hall meeting. Our thanks to the candidates, the commission, Washington University, and to everybody who watched. RADDATZ: Please tune in on October 19th for the final presidential debate that will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Good night, everyone.  © COPYRIGHT 2020 THE COMMISSION ON PRESIDENTIAL DEBATES. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.'"

(CNN); and<br />Jake Tapper (CNN)</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, this is the CNN Republican presidential debate.</p>\\n<p>We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world watching us on CNN, CNN Max, CNN International, CNN en Espanol, and CNN.com.</p>\\n<p>Good evening. I\\'m Jake Tapper, moderating tonight\\'s debate alongside my friend and colleague Dana Bash.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> And just five days from now, voters here in Iowa will cast the first votes of the 2024 presidential race.</p>\\n<p>Tonight, the very first one-on-one matchup between top contenders Governor Ron DeSantis and former Governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Former President Trump met the requirements for tonight\\'s debate, but declined to participate.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Our commitment in this debate is to provide as much information as possible to voters, especially here in Iowa, before the first contests begin next week.</p>\\n<p>So, in choosing topics, we focused on the issues important to Republicans.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s bring out the candidates now.</p>\\n<p>Please welcome Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Please welcome former South Carolina Governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Candidates, please take your positions behind the podiums while we remind you and our audience of the ground rules.</p>\\n<p>Each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions, 60 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Timing lights will remind you when time is expiring.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> We also remind our audience here in the Sheslow Auditorium at Drake University to be respectful, so the candidates can hear the questions and can hear each other.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Just hours ago, the Republican field narrowed once again. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ended his bid for the presidency.</p>\\n<p>So, with one fewer candidate in the running, let\\'s start with the decision voters here in Iowa are about to face.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, why should voters who are looking for an alternative to the current front-runner, former President Trump, vote for you, rather than former Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, to people of Iowa, good evening. It\\'s great to be in Iowa to have a debate here.</p>\\n<p>Donald Trump\\'s running to pursue his issues. Nikki Haley\\'s running to pursue her donors\\' issues. I\\'m running to pursue your issues and your family\\'s issues and to turn this country around. I\\'m the only one running that\\'s delivered on 100 percent of the promises that I have made.</p>\\n<p>We have delivered huge victories in the state of Florida, things that Republicans have been asking for, for a generation. I\\'m also the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again. We beat the teachers union on universal school choice. We beat Soros on crime. We beat Fauci on COVID. We beat the Dems on election integrity. And I beat the left by banning China from buying land in the state of Florida.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley is running. We don\\'t need another mealymouthed politician who just tells you what she thinks you want to hear just to try to get your vote, then to get in office and to do her donors\\' bidding.</p>\\n<p>She was in another state, and she said the people of Iowa\\'s votes need to be corrected. This is somebody that wrote in her book that Hillary Clinton inspired her to first run for office.</p>\\n<p>I remember Hillary denigrating people on the Republican side as deplorables. We don\\'t need a candidate who\\'s going to look down on Middle America. We have had enough of that. I\\'m the only one that\\'s going to be able to lead this country\\'s revival.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m asking for your support, and I won\\'t let you down.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, a response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think this is a time that we know that we need a new generational leader.</p>\\n<p>We have watched our country be in disarray. We see the world on fire, and we need someone who\\'s had executive experience. I have been a two- term governor that took a double-digit unemployment state and turned it into an economic powerhouse. I was at the U.N. I dealt with Russia, China, Iran every day.</p>\\n<p>But, you\\'re going to find out tonight that there is going to be a lot of Ron\\'s lies that has happened. There are at least a couple of dozen so far that he has done. So, what we\\'re going to do is rather than have him go and tell you all these lies, you can go to DeSantislies.com and look at all of those. There is at least two dozen lies that he has told about me, and you can see where a fact checker say exactly what\\'s going to happen and exactly why it\\'s wrong.</p>\\n<p>So, it will cover the fact that he is only mad about the donors because the donors used to be with him, but they\\'re no longer with him now. And that\\'s because he is upset about the fact that his campaign is exploding. You\\'re going to see the fact that he has switched his policies multiple times, and we\\'ll call that out tonight. But, every time he lies, Drake University, don\\'t turn this into a drinking game, because you will be overserved by the end of the night.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I think this is interesting, because you can actually go to RonDesantis.com, because Nikki Haley has this tactic. If you hold her accountable to her record, first she\\'ll say, I never said that. Well, one good rule of thumb, if she says she has never said something, that definitely means she said it, and then she\\'ll say you\\'re lying, you\\'re lying. That means not only did she say it but she is on videotape saying it. And so, we have all the greatest hits. The reality is Nikki Haley is not somebody that has been willing to stand in and fight on behalf of conservatives.</p>\\n<p>You know, she ran for governor saying she was going to do universal school choice, and she caved to the teachers union. She didn\\'t deliver that. In Florida, I delivered the largest expansion of school choice in the history of the United States. I beat the teachers union, and you know what the results are? When she was governor of South Carolina, she was rated 50th in education, dead last. You know, where Florida is under my watch, number one in the nation.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Your response, Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Go to DeSantislies.com and you can find out for yourself. But, why don\\'t we talk about the fact that if we\\'re going to say this, when Ron was representing Florida, he said that he promised not to raise the debt limit when he got to D.C. Yet, he raised the debt limit by hundreds of billions of dollars. He used to support Ukraine. He supported Ukraine when President Obama was in office. Now, he is trying to copy Trump and saying that he no longer supports Ukraine, and doesn\\'t want to give them foreign aid anymore. He also goes and says that he wants to talk about me insulting Iowans. Iowans know when you\\'re telling a joke.</p>\\n<p>The fact that he is only running in one state is not the way you win President. I\\'m running it all states. But, he should tell Iowans why he authored legislation to ban the renewable fuel standard that\\'s so important to Iowans\\' economy, and the fact that he co-sponsored five different pieces of legislation to get rid of it. And also, then he also said he would never do anything with Social Security. Yet, he voted three times to raise the retirement age of Social Security.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, if you\\'re going to talk about what you said --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- and you did, I think you\\'ve got your own explaining to do --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Well, we\\'re going to --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- rather than telling lies about --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> -- well, thank you, Governor. We\\'re going to get to a lot of these issues in the debate. Governor Haley, when Governor Christie dropped out of the race just a few hours ago, he said the most important issue is \"the character of the candidate\". Governor Christie also said he ran because he knew he would be the only Republican candidate to speak the truth about former President Donald Trump. Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be President again?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think the next President needs to have moral clarity. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that it\\'s taxpayer money, not your own money. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that when you\\'re dealing with dictators in the world, that we always have to fight for democracies and human rights and protecting Americans and preventing war.</p>\\n<p>And so, when you look at Donald Trump, I have said, I think he was the right President at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies, but his way is not my way. I don\\'t have vengeance. I don\\'t have vendettas. I don\\'t take things personally. For me, it\\'s very much about no drama, no whining and getting results and getting them done. So, I don\\'t think that President Trump is the right President to go forward. I think it\\'s time for a new generational leader that\\'s going to go and make America proud again. That\\'s what I\\'m going to try and do.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, what is your response to Chris Christie? Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be President again?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I\\'m running because I\\'m the guy that\\'s going to be able to engineer a comeback for this country. I appreciated what President Trump did. But, let\\'s just be honest. He said he was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to drain the swamp. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to hold Hillary accountable and he let her off the hook. He said he was going to eliminate the debt and he added $7.8 trillion to the debt. So, we need to deliver and get this stuff done.</p>\\n<p>And I think the difference between Nikki Haley and me, and I listened to all that litany of stuff, I debated the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom. I thought he lied a lot. Man, Nikki Haley made -- gives him a run for his money and she may even be more liberal than Gavin Newsom is. We are in a situation here in Florida.</p>\\n<p>And as Republicans, you need somebody that is going to be in there and fight for you. And Nikki Haley, any time the going gets tough, any time people come down, she caves. When you need someone standing and fight for you, don\\'t look for Nikki Haley. You won\\'t be able to find her if you had a search warrant. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Look, I think I dealt with Russia, China, Iran, North Korea every day. No one ever said I caved. I defended America and I fought for America. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>But I\\'ll also say this. This is not a time where you have to have pettiness. I wish Donald Trump was up here on this stage. He\\'s the one that I\\'m running against. He\\'s the one that I wish would be here. He needs to be defending his record. Right now he\\'s not defending the fact that he allowed us to have $8 trillion in debt over four years that our kids are never going to forgive us for. The fact that he didn\\'t deal with China when it came to stealing intellectual property. The fact that they gave us COVID. The fact that they have gone and continued to put up Chinese police stations and continue to threaten our military.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\'t do enough to make sure that we were really standing with our friends and doing some other things. What we need is a leader that\\'s not looking at four years and eight years. We need a president that\\'s looking at 20 and 30 years. Because I want my kids to have a good future. I want them to have one without debt, one where they can read, one with secure borders, one where we have law and order, and one where America is strong.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, with all due respect, you know, for her to single out Donald Trump on China, and, look, I think he could have been tougher on them, 100 percent. When Nikki Haley was governor of South Carolina, she was the number one governor in America for Republicans of bringing China into her state. She wrote a love letter to the ambassador saying that they were a great friend. She is on video saying China is a friend. She had a business, five -- Chinese business five miles from a military base. There is video of her on the website right in front of a Chinese flag saying that she works for them now.</p>\\n<p>So that was her number one achievement as governor was bringing China into the state of South Carolina. So you say you\\'re going to look 10, 20, 30 years down the road? Why wasn\\'t she doing that then when people were raising the red flags about it?</p>\\n<p>In Florida, I banned China from buying land in our state.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Yes, but, Governor DeSantis...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And we kicked them out of our universities. That\\'s what you need to be doing. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re going to talk about China in a little bit. I want to talk about the economy, which according to a recent Des Moines Register poll shows that the economy is the top issue for caucus-goers here.</p>\\n<p>So, Governor Haley, the rate of inflation is down. Prices, though, are still high, and Americans are struggling to afford food, cars, and housing. What is the single most important policy that you would implement as president to make the essentials in Americans\\' lives more important?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think we have to acknowledge that Republicans and Democrats have both done this. I mean, the fact that they\\'ve done all of this wasteful spending, they did a $2.2 trillion COVID stimulus bill that expanded welfare that\\'s now left us with 80 million Americans on Medicaid, 42 million Americans on food stamps. That\\'s a third of our country.</p>\\n<p>What I will do is I think it\\'s time we have an accountant in the White House. We have to have someone that respects taxpayer dollars. And we\\'ll start by clawing back $100 billion of unspent COVID dollars that are still out there.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ll go and instead of 87,000 IRS agents going after middle America, we\\'ll go after the hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID fraud, 1 out of every $7. If 8 percent of our budget is interest, quit borrowing. Cut up the credit cards.</p>\\n<p>I had to balance a budget as governor. You have to balance a budget every day. Why is Congress the only group that refuses to balance a budget? We\\'ll stop the spending. We\\'ll stop the borrowing. We\\'ll eliminate the pet projects and the earmarks. And I\\'ll veto any spending bill that doesn\\'t take us back to pre-COVID levels.</p>\\n<p>And then we want to make sure that we allow the middle class to breathe. We\\'re going to eliminate the federal gas and diesel tax in this country and cut taxes on the middle class and simplify those brackets. And then we want to make the small business tax cuts permanent. They made corporate tax cuts permanent, but they made small business tax cuts temporary. Small businesses are the heartbeat of America. We need to prove it by making those tax cuts permanent. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, what\\'s your response? How would you make those essentials more affordable for Americans?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I disagree with Ambassador Haley. We don\\'t need an accountant in the White House, we need a leader in the White House. And that\\'s what I would bring. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve spoken with Iowans, visiting all 99 counties, and also folks all across this country. The American dream is slipping away. People are working hard. They\\'re getting the most out of their God- given ability. They\\'re doing everything right. And they\\'re falling further and further behind.</p>\\n<p>Trying to afford a new home today, your monthly mortgage payment would probably be twice as much as what it would have been if you were starting out five years ago. We have to make the economy work their those folks.</p>\\n<p>Yes, I\\'m going to battle the spending. In Florida, you look and we have the national debt clock going up to $34 trillion. I see it. If you did a debt clock for the state of Florida, it would be counting down.</p>\\n<p>Because we\\'ve paid down 25 percent of our state debt just since I\\'ve been governor. We\\'re going to open up all energy for production because that will be deflationary.</p>\\n<p>You know, Nikki Haley when she was governor, she promised she would never do the gas tax. Then she tried to raise the gas tax on hardworking South Carolinians. Here\\'s the thing. We need to fly a flag of bold colors carrying the banner of putting the American people first, not the pale pastel of the warmed over corporatism of people like Nikki Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, I want to bring you in, but because Governor DeSantis mentioned the gas tax, you do want to eliminate the federal gas tax. And that tax generated approximately $40 billion in 2022 and helps pay for road construction and repair.</p>\\n<p>So how would you fix America\\'s roads and bridges if you take that money away?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, bless his heart. Desantislies.com. We have never raised a tax.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You try to.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> We\\'ve never raised a tax at all.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You tried. You\\'re on video.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I can tell you right --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So I can tell you that we killed the gas tax multiple times.</p>\\n<p>But what we said is if you want to raise the gas tax, you have to reduce the income tax by five times that amount. They didn\\'t want to do it. We\\'ve killed taxes every step of the way.</p>\\n<p>But if he\\'s going to talk about his economy, I think what we should say is why does Florida have the highest property insurance in the country? Why is it that it is named the American hotspot for inflation? Why is it that his state is now known to have the highest cost of living increases? And why is it that they\\'re saying senior citizens can no longer afford to live in Florida? So that\\'s the first thing I\\'ll say. We don\\'t need him doing that to our country.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to the gas tax, when we eliminate that federal tax, the money is collected in the states and they send it to the feds. The feds attach a lot of strings to it and send it back. 75 percent comes from the state, 25 percent comes from the federal government.</p>\\n<p>What they do when they add those strings is they pay for a lot of things that aren\\'t roads, green spaces, sidewalks, all of those things, but they attach strings. I want that money to stay in the states. I want the states to be able to decide how to spend it. I don\\'t want Washington bureaucrats deciding what we need for scenery and green space and all those other things. I want every state, including the state of Iowa, to make the decisions on how they spend their road spending instead of the federal government.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She kind of admitted that she did try to raise the gas tax, and she\\'s on video saying this. I know she\\'ll say she never said. But she did.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You snippet that.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She did -- she did do it.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You took a little piece of that. That is not true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She also -- she also raise tax --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You are lying again.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She was in South Carolina, that\\'s on the record. And she even proposed a tax on groceries at one point. But I\\'m just thinking, have you seen your grocery bill lately? That\\'s one of the things that\\'s hitting working people the most, that groceries are going up probably twice as much what you do.</p>\\n<p>But I also think it\\'s important that we lift people up. So in Florida, we eliminated all sales tax on every baby item, diapers, wipes, strollers, cribs. We want families to be able to prosper in this country. One of the things that\\'s causing so much problem is the breakdown in the American family. We\\'ve done a lot in Florida to be able to rejuvenate that. But we need to make it easier for people to raise children in this country so that we can have strong families in a strong country.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, at a CNN town hall last week, you said you support a flat tax, which is a single income tax rate for every American. Under your plan, would working families pay the same tax rate as billionaires?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I would only do it if people are better off than they are now. I mean, I want people paying less taxes. Actually, if you think the last year we have numbers for the federal government took in the highest percentage of taxes from the economy since World War II, and yet they\\'re going deep into debt.</p>\\n<p>We have a spending problem in this country. It\\'s not a tax problem in this country. And if you had something that was simple and transparent, not only would that better for economic growth, it\\'s also better to end the weaponization of government.</p>\\n<p>The IRS has been weaponized against conservatives going back to the Obama administration. I was there for that. No one\\'s been held accountable for doing that.</p>\\n<p>You look at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the weaponization of federal power ends the day I become the president of the United States. There\\'s going to be a new sheriff in town. We\\'re going to restore the constitutional accountability that our founding fathers envision when they formatted the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>And you know, I\\'ve talked to folks who have overbearing federal agencies. I mean, you have farmers who have the EPA coming on their farmland because there\\'s maybe a puddle there, waters of the United States. Give me a break.</p>\\n<p>So we\\'re going to reduce the size of government, but we\\'re also going to reduce the scope of government.</p>\\n<p>And in Florida, I\\'ve actually delivered on this, Florida has the lowest percentage of state government workers per capita in the country, and the cost of our state government employees is the lowest in the country.</p>\\n<p>No wonder why we\\'re paying down debt while we\\'re cutting taxes for people. That\\'s the way to do it. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, 15-second point of clarification. The question was whether or not working families would pay the same amount...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They would pay...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> ... as billionaires?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They would pay less than what they\\'re paying now. The way I view it is, OK -- and you\\'d exempt people -- so you would pay no tax for -- for working-class people. It would only be as you get above. Because I think the first $40,000, $50,000 grand, that\\'s just to subsist. And even some places, you can\\'t even do that.</p>\\n<p>So you would have no tax up to a certain point, and then it would just be a single rate. So if somebody...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... makes $100,000, they pay a certain amount. If someone makes $200,000, they pay...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They make twice as much, and they pay twice as much.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, first of all, you just can\\'t trust what he says. I mean, that\\'s the biggest thing. We don\\'t have a grocery tax in South Carolina. And I never once raised taxes, period.</p>\\n<p>But what I will tell you is, it is to call into question, why did he promise he\\'d never raise the debt limit and he turned around and he raised it?</p>\\n<p>And then you want to go, and you see one side of what he says early on, and then he changes it. So here he goes and he says that he is all for energy independence. He wants to get the EPA out of the way. Well, why did he run on the fact that he wanted to ban fracking and ban offshore drilling?</p>\\n<p>Why did he go and author that legislation to eliminate the renewable fuel standard that so -- that matters so much?</p>\\n<p>And why now is he suddenly coming to Iowa and saying, \"Oh, never mind, I don\\'t mean all of that?\"</p>\\n<p>Why did he call Trump and say that he wanted him to stop drilling nine miles into federal waters? Why is he now saying this?</p>\\n<p>Why do you come to the people of Iowa and say one thing when you campaigned and, on day two of your office, you banned fracking; you banned offshore drilling,; you turned around and authored and led the charge on banning the renewable fuel standards...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yeah...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You\\'ve got to stand up for those things that you did.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You\\'ve been -- you\\'ve been beating that dead horse -- that\\'s been the...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Because it\\'s true, Ron. It\\'s true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We\\'re looking forward to be able to open up energy production, and definitely here in the Midwest, with biofuels. I\\'m the only one that checked all the boxes from the Iowa renewable fuel standard, because I\\'ve actually visited all 99 counties. I\\'ve actually shown up to people\\'s farms. I\\'ve sat and I\\'ve listened to people about what they\\'re going through, how their economy is structured and how it\\'s important that we\\'re producing energy here in the United States.</p>\\n<p>I never want to go hat in hand, like Biden has done, to Venezuela or Saudi and begging for energy. We\\'re going to be able to open up production. We\\'re going to choose Midland over Moscow. We\\'re going to choose the Marcellus Shale over the mullahs. And we\\'re going to choose the Bakken over Beijing.</p>\\n<p>Energy independence isn\\'t even -- it\\'s not -- it\\'s good for consumers. It\\'s good to reduce inflation. And it\\'s one of the best things we can do for our national security. So we\\'ll do that on day one, and we are going to reverse Biden\\'s green new deal and the electric vehicle mandates. We\\'ll save the American automobile.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>This has been one of the biggest years for illegal border crossings into the United States. Last month alone, 225,000 migrants illegally crossed the southern border. It\\'s a record high, overwhelming the Border Patrol resources that are already stretched thin. Mayors across the country say their cities are being pushed to a breaking point.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, former President Trump famously promised to build a wall on the southern border. He obviously did not get that done. You have promised to finish the job. How will you succeed where he failed?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We will build a wall. We will actually have Mexico pay for it, in the way that I thought Donald Trump was. We\\'re going to charge fees on remittances that workers send to foreign countries, billions of dollars. We\\'ll build the wall.</p>\\n<p>He also promised record deportations. Donald Trump deported fewer people than Barack Obama did when he was president. Biden\\'s let in 8 million people just in four years. They all have to go back. We have to enforce the rule of law in this country.</p>\\n<p>Think about what\\'s happening to our country. Just this week, we saw the news that a high -- that a school in Brooklyn, New York, had the kids stay home. They were not able to go to school, told you can\\'t go get an in-person education. Why? Because their -- the city\\'s commandeering the school to house illegal aliens in it.</p>\\n<p>Talk about putting Americans last. You\\'re putting these kids out of an education because you can\\'t control the border?</p>\\n<p>Biden has failed in this endeavor. He has not taken care that the laws of this country be faithfully executed.</p>\\n<p>Do not trust Nikki Haley with illegal immigration. That\\'s like having the fox guard the hen house. She\\'s on tape at the Aspen Institute -- she\\'ll say she didn\\'t say it -- she was chastising conservatives, saying it\\'s disrespectful to illegal aliens to say that they\\'re criminals.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re violating the law. It\\'s disrespectful when people come to this country illegally and impose burdens on our communities and run drugs into this country. That\\'s what\\'s disrespectful.</p>\\n<p>She\\'s weak on immigration. She\\'s bankrolled by people who want open borders. And she said there shouldn\\'t be a limit on immigration; you should work with corporate CEOS...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thanks, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That is pale pastels. That is warmed-over...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you so much.</p>\\n<p>So, Governor Haley...[<i>cheering and applause</i>]... Governor DeSantis and also Donald Trump are attacking you for that comment in 2015 in which you said undocumented immigrants should not be called -- quote -- \"criminals.\"</p>\\n<p>At the time, the full context is you said -- quote -- \"We don\\'t need to talk about them as criminals. They\\'re not. They\\'re families that want a better life, and they\\'re desperate to get here\" -- unquote.</p>\\n<p>Do you still feel that way?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I saw them. When I was at the United Nations, I saw them. That doesn\\'t mean we should let them into our country.</p>\\n<p>I mean, first of all, I will tell you that, when I was governor of South Carolina, we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country. Obama sued us over it, and we won. We fought Obama on illegal immigration. We fought Obama on migrant kids. We fought Obama on Syrian refugees. We fought Obama on Guantanamo Bay prisoners.</p>\\n<p>I have always said we are a country of laws. The second we stop being a country of laws, we give up everything this country was founded on.</p>\\n<p>But I will tell you, in passing that toughest illegal immigration law in the country, we passed E-Verify, which I want to take national, which is where businesses have to prove that the people they hire are in this country legally. I passed it within six months of being governor. Ron didn\\'t pass it for five years.</p>\\n<p>He only waited to pass it when he decided to run for president. What we need to do is not just ban a wall. We need to put 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. We need to defund sanctuary cities once and for all, no more safe havens for illegal immigrants.</p>\\n<p>We need to make sure we go back to the remain-in-Mexico policy, so that no one even steps foot on U.S. soil. And instead of catch-and- release, we need to go to catch-and-deport. That\\'s the only way we will stop the incentives of these illegal immigrants coming across.</p>\\n<p>Biden turned around and gave half-a-million Venezuelans temporary protective status. That\\'s half-a-million driver\\'s licenses, half-a- million Social Security numbers. All that does is incentivize them to pick up the phone...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... call their family members, and tell them to come on ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She did bring...[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>When she was governor, she did bring Syrian refugees, and she got criticized for that.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> That is not true.

In fact, you have got them from China, Iran, Russia, the Middle East. When I was down there a couple years ago, because I have sent people down there, you had people from Libya and Haiti.</p>\\n<p>This is a ticking time bomb for this country. There are, of course, going to be terrorist cells that have come in. It\\'s like the lowest- cost way to be able to harm this country. Just send people across the southern border.</p>\\n<p>Nikki Haley also opposed the border wall in 2016. She said that -- she ridiculed it when Donald Trump was for that. I\\'m telling you, you need a wall. You can\\'t trust politicians to do this. If the wall\\'s there, it\\'s a physical fact of life. And it\\'s a huge step to restoring this country\\'s sovereignty.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis. Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Go to DeSantislies.com. I said, you can\\'t just build a wall. You have to do more than build a wall. It was having the wall and everything else. You can\\'t trust what Ron is saying.</p>\\n<p>But this is a bigger issue. This is more than him just constantly being desperate and throwing things on me. This is the fact that we have to realize my parents came here legally. They came the right way 50 years ago. They put in the time. They put in the price. They are offended by what\\'s happening on the border.</p>\\n<p>And my mom would always say, if they don\\'t follow the laws to come into this country, they won\\'t follow the laws when they are in this country. And we have to start treating this like it is. This is putting harm on our schools, on our hospitals. Taxpayers are paying for it. You see these mayors are now upset about it.</p>\\n<p>The only reason Eric Adams is now upset, why? He shouldn\\'t be a sanctuary city then. That\\'s why we have to defund sanctuary cities. Now Governor Abbott finally did to them what\\'s been happening to Texas for so long. We have got to put an end to this. It\\'s dangerous, and it doesn\\'t even count the fentanyl that\\'s happening.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you. Thank you, Governor. Thank you. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, there are more than 10 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States, according to Pew Research.</p>\\n<p>Will any of them be allowed to stay in the United States under your administration?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The number of people that will be amnestied when I\\'m president is zero.</p>\\n<p>We cannot do an amnesty in this country. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>First of all, all it\\'s going to do is cause more people to want to come illegally. So you have got to enforce the law. It\\'s got to be consistent. People got to know it\\'s there.</p>\\n<p>You also have to remove benefits for people who are here illegally. California, you can go, illegal alien, and you get free health insurance coverage. You\\'re here illegally, and they\\'re doing that? We should not let states provide these benefits.</p>\\n<p>In Florida, obviously, we don\\'t do that. We don\\'t allow the driver\\'s license and all that. But some states do. And it creates a magnet for people coming in. So, federally, no benefits, no enticements to come in, and then the states, we\\'re going to crack down on sanctuary states and sanctuary cities.</p>\\n<p>And I showed the hypocrisy of all this back in 2022 because we have a program to transport illegal aliens to sanctuary jurisdictions. And one of the places we sent 52, beautiful, liberal Martha\\'s Vineyard.</p>\\n<p>And you know what? These are folks that were on their high horse, saying how they were sanctuary jurisdiction, saying nobody is illegal. All refugees are welcome. That\\'s what they had in their town. The minute even 50 came up, they called the state of emergency and deported them off the island the next day. How do you think Texas feels? How do you think all these other communities feel that are overwhelming -- being overwhelmed?</p>\\n<p>So, we cannot have liberal elites in this country imposing policies on the rest of us that they are not willing to deal with the consequences of them.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, by the -- when you\\'re President, will any of the more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. be allowed to stay in the country under your administration?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You have to deport them. And the reason you have to deport them is they\\'re cutting the line. You\\'ve got people who have done this and tried to go through the right way. You can\\'t have them go and jump the line, and suddenly do that. And that is actually what will get them to stop coming, is when they do realize they get to the wall and they have to turn around and go back. It\\'s a dangerous process of what happens for them to try and migrate here.</p>\\n<p>But, when I was at the United Nations, and we had this, which is another reason why we need to have Trump here defending himself and talking about what he would do going in the future, because it\\'s a problem. I was on the ground in Honduras and Guatemala. And what we saw as a lot of the reason why they were coming from there is because of gangs and drugs. And so, what we did was we had our military go and train them on how to deal with gangs. We went and put drug boats on the water to keep the drugs from coming. But, we said you have to have them processed from here. You can\\'t have them come. We were able to stop that flow. We\\'ve got to go back to do that. But, we need to end it once and for all. Donald Trump didn\\'t do that. That\\'s why he needs to be here debating on the stage right now.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor, thank you. Let\\'s turn to foreign policy. You have expressed different visions for how the U.S. should approach the international complex. And I want to start with Ukraine. It\\'s been nearly two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and there is still no end in sight to that war. Governor Haley, you say that this is a \"war about freedom that Ukraine must win.\" Governor DeSantis says, \"We need to bring this war to an end.\" Do you believe he shares your commitment to a Ukrainian victory?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Nobody knows what he believes, because when President Obama was in office, he supported foreign aid to Ukraine. Now, he is copying Trump and trying to act like he doesn\\'t want to support Ukraine. But, let me tell you why Ukraine should matter. First of all, I don\\'t think we should give cash to any country, friend or foe, because you can\\'t follow it. You can\\'t hold it accountable. I don\\'t think we need to put troops on the ground. And Ukrainians want to win this themselves.</p>\\n<p>But, dictators always say, always do what they say they\\'re going to do. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. They did. Russia said they were going to invade Ukraine. They -- we watched it. China says Taiwan is next. We better believe them. Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. Those are NATO countries, and that puts America at war. This is about preventing war. It\\'s always been about preventing war.</p>\\n<p>If we support Ukraine, that\\'s only 3.5 percent of our defense budget. Biden and no one else is telling the American people the truth about that. The Europeans have put in more than that, and they should. It\\'s their neighborhood. But, this is a pro-American freedom-loving country. And we better remember that you have to be a friend to get a friend. And we needed a lot of friends, September 12. We\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re having the backs of the right friends, because if Russia wins, China wins. There is a reason the Taiwanese want us to help the Ukrainians. And that\\'s because they know if Ukraine wins, China won\\'t invade Taiwan. This is about preventing war.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I supported Trump\\'s policy vis-a-vis Russia, Ukraine, and it was successful. You know, the Biden policy has not been. But, Nikki Haley is basically a carbon copy of what Biden is. It\\'s an open-ended commitment. They want another $108 billion. They will not tell you when the -- they have achieved their goal. And this is going to go on maybe hundreds of billions more into the future. I think a lot of people have died. We need to find a way to end this, because our priorities for national security, of course, the border, which we talked about, and people like Nikki Haley care more about Ukraine\\'s border than she does about our own southern border, which is wrong.</p>\\n<p>But, we also have to look at what\\'s the top threat to this country. It\\'s the Chinese Communist Party. We are not doing what we need to do to have adequate hard power in the Indo-Pacific. And here is the thing. We don\\'t have enough resources, being $35 trillion in debt, to continue doing hundreds of billions of dollars. We got to focus on our issues here at home.</p>\\n<p>And we\\'ve got to deal with the top threat that we face, which is China.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> And then I wonder why you raised the debt when you were in Congress, because we\\'re all paying for that.</p>\\n<p>What I will tell you is, this is the lie they\\'re telling the American people over and over again. It is so wrong to say this. They\\'re saying you have to choose between Ukraine or Israel, or Israel and -- and securing the border. Supporting Ukraine is 3.5 percent of our budget. I don\\'t want cash going. It\\'s equipment and it\\'s ammunition. If we support Ukraine and Israel, that\\'s only 5 percent of our defense budget. If we support...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So you\\'re going to borrow that?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> If we support Ukraine, Israel, and secure the border, that\\'s less than 20 percent of Biden\\'s green subsidies. You do not have to choose when it comes to national security. This is about keeping Americans safe. This is about preventing war. This is about keeping our military men and women from having to fight a war. And you only do that when you focus on national security, not telling lies to the American people that they have to choose. That is wrong. That\\'s never been the case. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Here is the problem with what she\\'s saying. She -- she doesn\\'t articulate how this comes to an end, except she was asked after the last debate by, I believe, Megyn Kelly, and she said, you bring to it an end by bringing Ukraine into NATO. But, of course, we\\'re a NATO country. So if you bring Ukraine into NATO, that puts the United States at war. Megyn said that to her, and then she basically gave a word salad as to how you go from there.</p>\\n<p>So they have sent cash. She supports this $106 billion that they\\'re trying to get through Congress. Where is some of that money going? They\\'ve done tens of billions of dollars to pay salaries for Ukrainian government bureaucrats. They\\'ve paid pensions for Ukrainian retirees with your tax dollars?</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve got homeless veterans. We have all these problems. This is the U.N. way of thinking that we\\'re somehow globalists and we have unlimited resources to do. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>You know, I think here\\'s the problem. You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations, but you can\\'t take the United Nations out of the ambassador. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, I have never said that we should give salaries or benefits or anything else to Ukrainians. I have said it again, Ron, so stop lying. DeSantislies.com.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But you supported the aid packages.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So you go -- I did not support the aid package. I support equipment and ammunition going to Ukraine. I think it is incredibly important that we\\'re honest and say we have to focus on national security. Don\\'t go and lie to the American people to make them think we can\\'t do this.</p>\\n<p>You turned around and raised the debt limit. You\\'re the one that\\'s talked about, look at what you did to Florida. But think about the fact that he is talking about where is this money going to come from. You -- the best way to tell about a candidate is to see how they\\'ve run their campaign.</p>\\n<p>He has blown through $150 million. I don\\'t know how you do that. Through his campaign, he has nothing to show for it. He spent more money on private planes than he has on commercials trying to get Iowans to vote for him. If you can\\'t manage a campaign, how are you going to manage a country? Which is exactly...[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, listen, I\\'m proud of -- I\\'m proud that in the state of Florida, we\\'re ranked number one for economy of all 50 states by CNBC. Number one...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest cost of living.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... in education. She was ranked number 50 in education...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... when she was governor of California (ph)...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest insurance in the country.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, he...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... wasn\\'t able to do school choice. She didn\\'t deliver big tax cuts. We\\'re also number one for net end migration, number one for GDP growth amongst large states, number one for talent development, number one for new business formations, and on and on it goes.</p>\\n<p>So the success we\\'ve had in Florida, I can cite the statistics. It\\'s important. But just look at how people are voting with their feet. They\\'re leaving California. They\\'re leaving Illinois, New York, all these states, and they\\'re coming to Florida in record numbers because we\\'re doing it right.</p>\\n<p>And not only have I cut taxes big time, where she didn\\'t as governor of South Carolina, we\\'ve paid down 25 percent of our state\\'s debt. That\\'s how you manage the third-largest state in this country. Just imagine if we could do that for the United States of America. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So thank you. Let\\'s stay on foreign policy. I want to turn to the Israel-Hamas war. You both have said that you unequivocally support Israel. You both have called for the complete elimination of Hamas.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, there are real disagreements within Israel about how to handle what happens in Gaza after the war against Hamas is over. Some Israeli cabinet officials are pushing for the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza. Governor Haley told CNN last week she does not support that. Do you?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So we\\'ve got to support Israel in word and in deed, in public and in private. And they need to be able to finish the job. Joe Biden is kneecapping them. He\\'ll say one thing, then he goes and his base doesn\\'t like Israel, so he has got to do all these other things. This is a time to recognize that they\\'ve suffered the most deaths of Jews, murder of Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas wants a second Holocaust. They want to annihilate the state of Israel. So I think to be a good ally, you back them in the decisions that they\\'re making with respect to Gaza.</p>\\n<p>Look, there\\'s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you\\'re doing this. But for us to be sitting in Washington second guessing them, I don\\'t think that\\'s the right way.</p>\\n<p>We also have a disagreement. Governor Haley and I, when she was at the U.N., she supported the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs. The problem with that is the Palestinian Arabs don\\'t recognize Israel\\'s right to exist as a Jewish state. So doing a two-state solution doesn\\'t create something that\\'s going to lead to a lasting peace. It creates a stepping stone for Israel\\'s destruction.</p>\\n<p>So under no circumstances as president am I going to pressure Israel to risk their security to do a so called two-state solution. She was wrong when she embraced that. And we\\'re right to say we trust Israel to make these decisions. They\\'re a good ally of ours. We should trust their judgment on these sensitive issues.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, 15 seconds, 15 seconds clarification. Do you support the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So as president, I am not going to tell them to do that. I think there\\'s a lot of issues with that. But if they make the calculation that to avert a second holocaust, they need to do that. I think some of these Palestinian Arabs, Saudi Arabia should take some.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Egypt should take some. They\\'ve never been willing to accept any of these facts in their own neighborhood.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor. Thank you, governor. Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, we need to understand the reason we need to support Israel is Israel\\'s a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. They are the tip of the spear when it comes to defeating terrorism. It has never been that Israel needs America. It has always been that America needs Israel.</p>\\n<p>When I was at the United Nations, I fought every day for Israel. And if you would have listened to what I said at the United Nations, a two-state solution wasn\\'t something that was possible because Israel would always come to the table and the Palestinians wouldn\\'t.</p>\\n<p>But right now, we have to make sure that Israel has the support that it needs. There should be three things. Give Israel whatever it wants to get the job done. Two, eliminate Hamas once and for all. And three, do whatever it takes to bring the hostages home.</p>\\n<p>But it\\'s really rich that Ron is going to act like he suddenly cares for Israel when he brought the person to Iowa that\\'s the most anti- Israel Republican in the state, the person that went and voted against Israel\\'s right to exist in Congress, the person that voted with the squad against antisemitism on college campuses.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> And you brought that person --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- to Iowa to go and campaign with. That\\'s your friend.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, she\\'s obviously referring to Congressman Tom Massey from Kentucky.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yes. I mean, that\\'s just cheap garbage. But here\\'s the thing. When the attack --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> -- happened against Israel, I knew it was going to be a big deal for Florida. We have one of the largest Israeli American populations in the country, and we\\'ve been a haven for orthodox Jews in particular since I\\'ve been governor. And you know what? Biden wasn\\'t helping Americans get out of the war zone. These are people that were stranded. So I did an executive order. We scrambled planes and we rescued over 700 Americans from Israel and brought them back safely to the state of Florida. You got to step up and you got to lead when things like this are happening.</p>\\n<p>We also have gone after the antisemitism on our campuses. We did that early in my administration. You didn\\'t see our college presidents doing some of the things that you\\'ve seen.</p>\\n<p>I just announced in the state of the state address yesterday or two days ago that we are going to say not just for Jewish students, anyone who\\'s having religious, being persecuted or being marginalized because of their faith in any college around the country, we\\'re going to waive the transfer requirements so that people can come to Florida and be safe.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> What they are doing to Jewish students has been reprehensible.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We\\'re not going to let it out.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So there are -- I\\'m coming to you. There are growing fears of this war escalating into a broader regional conflict. And, Governor Haley, just yesterday the U.S. Navy shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by Iranian backed militants in the Red Sea. Iranian backed militants are now also attacking U.S. and western interests in Syria and Iraq. Your fellow South Carolinian Republican senator Lindsey Graham is calling for the U.S. to conduct retaliatory strikes inside Iran. Would you order strikes inside Iran?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, notice Ron didn\\'t say anything about the fact that he did bring that most anti-Israel Republican into this state to campaign. He also hasn\\'t told you that the only Republican Jewish state legislator left his campaign because he wasn\\'t dealing with the neo-Nazi marches and wasn\\'t dealing with antisemitism properly.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to Iran, what we have to understand, there would be no Hamas without Iran. There would not be Houthis without Iran. There wouldn\\'t be Hezbollah without Iran. And when you look at the strikes that are happening in Iraq and Syria, that is because of Ron. They\\'re pulling the puppet strings.</p>\\n<p>What we need to do is the idea that we\\'ve had over 130 strikes on our men and women in Iraq and Syria is unconscionable. We\\'re supposed to have their backs. And Biden has been slow. He\\'s been hiding in a corner and he hasn\\'t dealt with it.</p>\\n<p>We need to go and take out every bit of the production that they have that\\'s allowing them to do those strikes. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. And you can\\'t do that if you have a secretary of defense that is in ICU and the president doesn\\'t even know about it.</p>\\n<p>Look, there\\'s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you\\'re doing this.

They fund Hamas. They fund Hezbollah. We did a special session of the legislature down in Florida. We expanded sanctions against Iran. If we were our own country, we\\'d be the 14th largest economy in the world.</p>\\n<p>The root of this is Biden came into office and he relaxed the sanctions on Iran.

And that is, what is the role of government, and should it use its power to go after businesses and private entities that take actions that don\\'t align with conservative values?</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, you used your powers in Florida to take on Disney after the company criticized an education bill that you signed into law. How does that square with the traditional conservative view that small, limited government is best?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The proper role of government, if it means every -- anything, it\\'s to protect our kids.</p>\\n<p>And I have stood for the innocence of our kids. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>It is wrong -- it is wrong to sexualize the curriculum. It\\'s wrong -- my wife and I, we have got a first grader, a kindergarten and a preschooler.</p>\\n<p>This is something that\\'s important to us personally. It\\'s wrong to tell a kindergartner, like Disney wanted to do, that you can change your gender or tell a third grader that you\\'re born in the wrong body. So I stood up against -- yes, the media didn\\'t like it, the left didn\\'t like it, and Disney didn\\'t like it.</p>\\n<p>And they\\'re the 800-pound gorilla in the state of Florida. Most people, most corporate Republicans would have caved. I stood and I fought for the kids. We took on Disney, and we defeated that and we won that fight and our kids are better off.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley sided with Disney. She invited them to South Carolina, even though they were involved in transing kids. That is not what we need to do. But I think that\\'s similar. She is representative of this corporatist element of the party. For example, she supported $900 million in subsidies to Boeing when she was in South Carolina. And then, when she got out of office, she took a seat on their board, and she made millions of dollars. Then she gave speeches, paid speeches, to a lot of Wall Street interests, didn\\'t publish what she said. We don\\'t know what she promised them.</p>\\n<p>And she made millions of dollars doing that. Now they\\'re the ones that are funding her campaign. So we need to stand up for the people, and not bow down to woke corporations. And we know Nikki Haley will cave to the woke mob every single time. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, a response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people.</p>\\n<p>And what we don\\'t need is government politicizing anything. The first thing I will say is, again, DeSantislies.com, because I have never said anything related to the transgender stuff he says. I have always fought to protect kids. I have always said that boys need to go into boys\\' bathrooms, girls need to go into girls\\' bathrooms, that we shouldn\\'t have any gender transitions before the age of 18.</p>\\n<p>Just like we don\\'t have tattoos before the age of 18, we shouldn\\'t have gender transformation or puberty blockers. But I will tell you that it\\'s really interesting that Ron talks about this -- Disney, because Disney has been woke for a long time.</p>\\n<p>They were against the immigration situation that Trump was doing. They were against the Paris climate agreement when I did it. They were against the pro-life bill in Georgia. Ron didn\\'t have any problem with that. As a matter of fact, he gave them the largest corporate subsidies in Florida history.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That\\'s false.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> He had tech exemptions that he gave -- didn\\'t give any tech exemptions to anybody but Disney.</p>\\n<p>Yet, when they went and criticized him, he got thin-skinned and suddenly started to fight back. We don\\'t need government fighting against our private industries. We are not woke in South Carolina. I will always invite businesses to come to South Carolina.</p>\\n<p>But the one thing you don\\'t do is, government doesn\\'t bully our businesses. And that can\\'t happen. And Ron has determined anybody that offends him...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... he goes after them, and he will use government...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She just said she\\'s always fought to protect kids.

I\\'m glad she\\'s come to the right thing.</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the deal, it goes back to that young kid in the town hall that she had where he said, Nikki Haley, you are the new John Kerry, you are for it before you were against it.

And if there are any other exceptions, they use a private bathroom.</p>\\n<p>I have fought for women\\'s sports and making sure that biological boys are not in women\\'s sports.

Given that, why should voters concerned about K through 12 education support you rather than other Republicans?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Because I think what we did was we knew that there was an issue. We knew in South Carolina if a child couldn\\'t read by third grade they were four times less likely to graduate high school. So what we did is, we started holding kids back instead of pushing them forward. We brought in their parents. We did reading remediation. And we set them up for success.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve got to do that all over the country. We only had 31 percent of eighth graders in the country are proficient in reading, 27 percent of eighth graders are proficient in math. If we don\\'t do something, we\\'re going to be in a world of hurt 10 years from now.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s why I want to take as many federal programs from D.C. as we can and send them down to the state level. Think education. We can move a lot of K through 12 programs down to the state level, reduce the strings that are attached, and that way states can handle it themselves. People in Iowa know best what types of education they need.</p>\\n<p>Secondly, parents should decide what types of education their children get, what mode of education. And we should have complete transparency in the classroom. No parent should ever wonder what\\'s being said or taught to their child in the classroom. That\\'s why we\\'ll have all of the curriculums online for every parent to see.</p>\\n<p>And we need to start putting vocational classes back in our high schools. Let\\'s teach our kids how to do things. We did that in South Carolina. We had apprenticeships. We taught our kids how to build the things we are making.</p>\\n<p>When we start putting education back in the states and away from D.C., that\\'s when we\\'ll start to see that we are going back to the basics. We\\'re doing what parents want. And we\\'re doing what the industries...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... in that state need.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, I\\'m coming to you right now. Governor DeSantis, you have supported limits on what subjects can be taught and how, including American history in Florida schools. You have also made it easier to remove books from public school libraries. You say you want to, quote, \"make America Florida.\" Do you want to implement those Florida school policies nationwide?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I\\'ll get to that in a sec. So Nikki Haley said she wants parents to decide on the education. She campaigned for governor saying she was going to do school choice, to be able to give private scholarships, particularly to low-income families. And she was governor and never did it. She caved to the teachers union.</p>\\n<p>I delivered the biggest school choice expansion in the history of the United States. We beat the teachers union. We\\'ve even done paycheck protection so that school unions -- so that teachers aren\\'t force to do dues, and now they\\'re choosing other things. So we\\'ve done it right in Florida. And the results speak for themselves.</p>\\n<p>We have one of the top performing fourth grade reading and math in the country. And if you just took our charter school population, 365,000 kids, disproportionately low income, racial, ethnic minorities, if they were their own state, they\\'d be in the top five in performance. Everyone can succeed, but you\\'ve got to have a leader who\\'s going to fight the teachers unions and is going to deliver school choice.</p>\\n<p>Governor Kim Reynolds did that here in Iowa, who\\'s endorsed me. Nikki Haley did not. She failed. And if she can\\'t do it in the reddest state in the country of South Carolina, how are you going to be able to succeed in Washington, D.C.?</p>\\n<p>Now, in terms of what we\\'ve done, we believe in empowering parents, and there are certain standards about what\\'s age and developmentally appropriate. It\\'s wrong to have pornographic materials in fourth or fifth grade. And you know what\\'s happened? They\\'ll go to school board meetings all around the country. They\\'ll start reading it and they, oh, no, no, it\\'s too graphic. You can\\'t read it here. You can\\'t put it on the 6:00 news.</p>\\n<p>Well, if it\\'s not appropriate in a school board meeting and you can\\'t put on the 6:00 news, why are you jamming it down the throats of a fourth grader?</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor, just a point of clarification, do you want to implement Florida\\'s education policies nationwide?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> It depends on the policy. School choice universal, yes. I don\\'t want a nationalized curriculum. I think that that\\'s a bottom up thing. I want to get rid of the federal Department of Education, get that weight off the backs of the state and local governments. But we are going to do nationwide scholarships through the tax credits, and that\\'s going to bail out a lot of poor kids throughout this country.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I have fought for school choice in my entire career because I think parents know their children best, and I think we should always do that. That\\'s why we passed charter school legislation in our state. That\\'s why we empowered homeschoolers in our state. That\\'s why we changed the funding formula. So, we lifted up challenged areas without bringing down the wealthy areas.</p>\\n<p>We wanted school choice. I had a Republican legislature that wouldn\\'t do it, but we pushed hard to get that done. That doesn\\'t mean that we shouldn\\'t do it across the country. But what we have to do is we have to make it state centric. We\\'ve got to get these programs down to the state level. We\\'ve got to let the focus be on teachers. Teachers right now have to be the guidance counselors, the pastors, the nurses and everything in between. And, oh, by the way, they have to teach to a test. That\\'s not what teachers want. Teachers want to do what they were taught to do. And that means math, science, reading, history, English, arts. That\\'s it.</p>\\n<p>Schools can\\'t be all things to all kids. They need to let the parents parent. They need to let teachers teach. And we need to go back to the basics in education so we get our kids --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. I want to move on.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That is the problem, though. That word salad is the problem.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She said she\\'s always supported school choice and she failed to deliver. She blames other people. Leadership is about getting things done. Stop making excuses. Make it happen.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> If leadership is about getting things done, how did you blow through $150 million in your campaign, and you were down in the polls. You are not a man of word. No, I\\'m going to say --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think it\\'s very instructive about what Nikki Haley sees the world.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think I have the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, Governor Haley --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> What is more important here? She\\'s saying somehow that that\\'s not --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, it\\'s Governor Haley\\'s time. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think I hit a nerve. What I will tell you is, look, if you can\\'t manage a campaign -- it\\'s been a revolving door of political people in and out of his campaign. You\\'ve heard of campaign people going to blows with each other because they can\\'t all agree. $150 million, and he spent more on private planes than commercials. I flew commercial. I stayed in residence inns. We went and saved our money. We made sure we spent it right because you have to understand, it\\'s not your money, it\\'s other people\\'s money, and you have to know how to handle it. If he can\\'t handle the financial parts of a campaign, how is he going to handle the economy when it comes to the White House?</p>\\n<p>And he goes, and he has been demeaning me over and over again, telling lies, desantislies.com, because he thinks it makes him look bigger. But in the one basic thing, you\\'ve campaigned for president in one state, you\\'re invisible in New Hampshire, you\\'re invisible. In South Carolina, you\\'re in fifth place, you\\'ve got $150 million and you\\'ve gone down in the polls in Iowa. Why should we think you can manage or do anything in this country?</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> This is a great window into leadership because she focused on a lot of political process stuff, things that no voter cares about, and she couldn\\'t tell you why she failed to deliver school choice to people in her state after she promised it. So, she says somehow that is the indicative of me.</p>\\n<p>No, leadership is about producing results. We\\'ve produced the results in Florida. We did universal school choice. We\\'ve cut taxes, we banned sanctuary cities on and on down the line, everything I promised, I delivered. She doesn\\'t have a rationale for why she couldn\\'t get it done. That is poor leadership. You look at me. Everything I promised I would do, I\\'ve delivered. And you can expect nothing less when I\\'m the president of the United States.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re going to move on now.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I need to respond to that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, you want to talk about leadership, and he wants to go and demean and put down. Let me tell you what leadership is. Leadership is the fact that I went into South Carolina that had 11 percent unemployment rate. Leadership is the fact that we turned it into an economic powerhouse, building planes, building cars, building tires.</p>\\n<p>We were named the beasts of the southeast. We moved the 11 percent unemployment down to 4 percent. We announced jobs in every county in the state. We moved 35,000 people on welfare to work. We changed our prison system to where we now have the lowest recidivism rate in the country. We passed voter I.D. We passed tort reform. We did pension form. We paid down our debt. We cut taxes. We made sure that people were proud again. We did eVerify in the first six months, not five years, like Ron.</p>\\n<p>So, don\\'t go and pick on school choice and say that that\\'s leadership. When I got to the U.N., we cut a billion dollars off the top, and we took the kick me sign off of our backs, and America was respected again at the U.N. I know what leadership is.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re moving on to a topic, governors, that both of you have made central to your campaigns, and that is China. Governor Haley, American farmers were hurt by former President Trump\\'s trade war with China. As a result, his administration paid out $28 billion in subsidies to farmers. You have vowed to be even tougher than Donald Trump on China. If your trade policies also end up hurting America\\'s farmers, are you prepared to cut a check just like he did?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, that\\'s why Trump should be here on this debate stage. He should have to defend it. So, first of all, I\\'ve said China is our number one national security threat. I fought them every single day at the United Nations. I know what they\\'re capable of. The first thing we have to do is we have to make sure we stop selling them any land and we take back the land they already purchased. We need to go to our universities and we say, you either take Chinese money or you take American money but the days of taking both are over. We need to stop all of the technologies that are going to China. Biden approved 70 percent of them. Trump approved even more than that. We have to tell them we\\'re going to end all normal trade relations with them until they stop murdering Americans with fentanyl. And we need to make sure we build up our military.</p>\\n<p>But the biggest thing, I was very attached to China in terms of trade, and the one thing we\\'ll do is we won\\'t wait for the China to pull the rug out from under Iowans. What we\\'ll do is instead, we will move that trade to where we have friends. We will go and build partnerships, India, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Australia, Israel. We will go and move that trade over.</p>\\n<p>Right now, you can ask our farmers when they go and they buy from China, China orders, cancels the order, then goes and tries to buy it cheap. That\\'s what China does. Our farmers deserve better than that. We will get them trade deals.</p>\\n<p>When I was governor in South Carolina, we sold and we exported everything we were making in South Carolina. When I\\'m president, we will sell and export everything that\\'s being made in Iowa to those that are our friends, not our enemies.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor DeSantis, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The way you deal with China is threefold. One, we need more hard power in the Indo-Pacific. I\\'m a Navy guy. We need more sea power. We\\'re going to build that up and we\\'re going to have a strategy to deny their ability to invade Taiwan or to get beyond the first island chain. On the current course, they\\'re going to take advantage of Biden and we\\'re going to rue the day when that happens.</p>\\n<p>Second, we got to decouple our economy, particularly things that are significant to our national survival. And you\\'ve got to be methodical, strategic about it. There\\'s a lot of moving parts there. But we\\'re going to do.</p>\\n<p>Nikki Haley\\'s not going to be able to do that because a lot of her supporters make a lot of money in China. And so she\\'s going to talk tough, but she\\'ll cave on that.</p>\\n<p>And then also with here in the United States, she\\'s saying they shouldn\\'t be buying land and be in the universities. When she was governor of South Carolina, the state gave China land and they were in the universities. As governor in Florida, I banned China from buying land and we kicked them out of our universities. That\\'s what you want to do.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> DeSantislies.com, he has an economic development arm. You had an office in Hong Kong. On the website, it said that Florida is a great place for Chinese companies to do business. And then when we called you out on it, you had the website scrubbed. So, we know that that\\'s the case. What I will tell you is we need to focus on what we\\'re going to do to become less dependent on China, and we need to make sure that we look at it through a national security lens.</p>\\n<p>When we had COVID, everybody told you to wear a mask. It was made in China. They told you to take a COVID test, you turned it over, it was made in China. If you go down the drugstore aisle, all those medicines are made in China. We need to make sure we\\'re getting medicines made here or we need to get it from our friends so that we\\'re not, in any way, threatened.</p>\\n<p>But I\\'ll tell you, Ron continues to sit there and talk about China. He has done expansions in China. His biggest donor that is backed by China gave them $340,000. So, don\\'t go and talk about donors and money. Go to desantislies.com and we\\'ll tell you all about it.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Look, I know your record hurts. I know your record sometimes because you\\'re being -- you\\'re talking the opposite of what you did. You were made a big effort to bring them into the state.</p>\\n<p>They had land near military base. You were in front of the Chinese flags saying you work for them. You wrote a love letter to the ambassador. That\\'s well-documented. You were the number one Republican governor in the country.</p>\\n<p>And even people that on the media who are hostile to me, they look, they say they can\\'t find one instance of me as governor recruiting a Chinese company because I haven\\'t done it. It\\'s not been part of that.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Desantislies.com is on there. It\\'s on there.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And the Enterprise Florida, we actually eliminated.</p>\\n<p>So, here\\'s the thing though. She\\'s backed by companies like BlackRock. She\\'s backed by major companies on Wall Street. They make a lot of money in China. There\\'s a reason why you\\'re in the mess you are in terms of trying to deal with the inflation and everything because the elites in this country have sold out the middle of the country for China. She is part of that now. And she\\'s not going to stand up for you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> I want to ask about something that you mentioned you\\'ve been talking a lot about on the campaign trail, which is decoupling the U.S. economy with China\\'s. China is a top supplier of goods to the United States. The U.S. sells more than $150 billion of goods to China every year. Is it really possible to sever economic ties without inflicting major pain on American business and American consumers?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Sure it is, and it\\'s something that you\\'ve got to be strategic, you\\'ve got to be methodical about. You\\'ve got to focus on the things that are of national significance. For example, I don\\'t think it\\'s good idea that the pharmaceuticals come from there, things for our military weaponry, all these important things that if we got into a worldwide conflict, we\\'re going to ask China, who may be on the other side of that, to continue doing that.</p>\\n<p>So, you got to be smart about it. You got to recognize that you\\'re going to have to do some incentives here in this country, tax incentives, regulatory incentives. But I want to make things here again.</p>\\n<p>You know, I look around the country. There\\'s parts of Iowa that have been hollowed out, particularly in the eastern part. And I\\'ve talked to folks and seen what that did for the community. We were sold a bill of goods by a lot of elites in this country that somehow putting China and the WTO and granting a most favorite nation status was going to lead to our manufacturing exporting a bunch of stuff there. Instead, they\\'ve gobbled up so much more manufacturing.</p>\\n<p>I don\\'t think you can be a first rate power unless you have a very strong industrial base. So, we\\'re going to do that here. We\\'re going to work on workforce education. Not everyone needs to do a four-year Brick and Ivy University. That\\'s not the best way or only way for people to succeed. We\\'re going to do skilled trades. We\\'re going to do vocational. We\\'ve done that in Florida. It\\'s going to be a really, really big thing.</p>\\n<p>But I just think the middle of the country has to have those good- paying jobs and we can\\'t put the interest of some of the people on Wall Street over the interests of Americans on Main Street.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Let\\'s move on to Social Security. Let\\'s move on to Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, Social Security will be unable to pay full benefits in a decade if no action is taken.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, you have said that you\\'re not going to, quote, mess with Social Security, unquote. Does that mean you have committed to never raising the retirement age and never cutting benefits?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So, all seniors out there, promise has been made to you. You\\'ve paid into this. Every single paycheck that you\\'ve had your entire life they\\'ve taken money out of, and that promise needs to be fulfilled.</p>\\n<p>So, that will happen when I\\'m president. Of course, I have a lot of seniors in Florida that depend on Social Security. I know many of them. And I think back to my own grandmother who was -- lived until 91. Social Security was her sole source of income. So, promise made, promise kept.</p>\\n<p>You know, on the retirement age, you know, there used to be people would say, well, life expectancy is going up. Shouldn\\'t it mirror that? Well, the problem now in the last five years is life expectancy is going down. So, I don\\'t see how you can raise the retirement age when our life expectancy is collapsing in this country. That\\'s a huge problem in and of itself.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ll work with both sides of the aisle. We\\'ll work on something for the long-term strengthening, but I am not going to mess with seniors\\' benefits. In this high-inflation environment, groceries are going through the roof, rent is going through the roof, all these staples, and you get a cost of living adjustment, but that\\'s not enough to cover the costs that have been increased.</p>\\n<p>So, seniors are really strapped, particularly those that are on fixed income, and they have to know that we\\'re going to deliver when it comes to their Social Security check.</p>\\n<p>Now, we\\'re going to get inflation down. We\\'re going to get energy costs down. There\\'s going to be a lot of things that are going to help seniors, but I think seniors should know promise made will be a promise kept.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So just a point of clarification, 15 seconds, removing current seniors from the equation, you\\'re not saying that you\\'re committing to never raising the retirement age or cutting benefits.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I would never raise the retirement age in the face of a declining life expectancy. I mean, I think that that would be really bad. I mean, just think about it, that hurts blue collar folks. You get taxed your entire life, life expectancy is down. You may not even be recouping very many benefits. And so life expectancy is declining. That\\'s a big problem.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Three years in a row, he voted to raise life expectancy to 70 years old, three years in a row. Go to desantislies.com and you\\'ll see it. So, now suddenly he\\'s going to tell you because he\\'s running for president and he\\'s not going to do it, you can\\'t trust him.</p>\\n<p>What I\\'ll tell you is Social Security is going to go bankrupt in ten years. Medicare is going to go bankrupt in eight. He talks about taking care of seniors right now, Florida is the inflation hotspot. It\\'s the highest cost of living of any state in the country. Seniors are having to leave because they can\\'t afford it. It\\'s documented in desantislies.com.</p>\\n<p>What I\\'ll tell you we have to do is we have to keep our promises to senior years, but we also can\\'t put our head in the sand for those like Ron saying they\\'re not going to touch Social Security. That means they\\'re going to leave after four or eight years and leave it bankrupt. No.</p>\\n<p>What we do is we go to those in their 20s and say we\\'re going to change the retirement age to reflect life expectancy. Instead of cost of living increases, we do increases based on inflation. We\\'d limit benefits on the wealthy and we expand Medicare advantage plans with seniors. That\\'s how we\\'ll deal with --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> With reducing the benefits, when you do the change in calculation, reducing the benefits, let\\'s just put this in perspective, under her administration, you would have seniors getting less cost of living adjustments while your tax dollars are going to pay the pensions of Ukrainian bureaucrats.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> That\\'s not true. That\\'s such a lie, Ron.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You talk about putting Americans last. That is wrong. You\\'ve supported all that money going over there. So, let\\'s put our own people first.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You\\'re so desperate. You\\'re just so desperate.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, let him speak.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And she also said -- she said recently that the age of Social Security is way too low, and I criticized that. And then she was called on it. And then she said, she never said it, of course, you\\'re lying. And then, sure enough, you put on the interview where she\\'s there, splitting image, and she says it\\'s way too low.</p>\\n<p>So, we can play this song and dance. She has a record. She makes statements. And I think part of the problem with her candidacy is now that she\\'s getting scrutiny, she\\'s got this problem with ballistic podiatry, shooting herself in the foot every other day, saying things that now she doesn\\'t even take questions from people.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, you want to raise the retirement age for younger Americans, but you have not said what that age should be. Should voters in their 20s plan on working until they\\'re 70?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, he hasn\\'t answered the fact that he voted to raise the retirement age to 73 different times. He can call me whatever name and be demeaning as much as he wants. It doesn\\'t change the fact that Ron is lying because Ron is losing. Everybody in the country sees it for what it is.</p>\\n<p>So, what I\\'ll tell you is, yes, we\\'re going to take on -- we\\'re going to be responsible with it and we\\'re going to go to those in our 20s.</p>\\n<p>When I said the retirement age was too low, again, where he\\'s lying, it\\'s because if you go, and you can go to desantislies.com, I said it\\'s too low, if we\\'re going to look at those in their 20s. We have to go and start looking at what we can do to get out of this. We want to make sure that everybody who was promised gets it.</p>\\n<p>But we also want to make sure our kids have something when they get it, too. So, the way we do that is exactly how I laid it out. Then we\\'ll know what we\\'re looking at and then we can start focusing.</p>\\n<p>The other thing is we need to start cutting spending in D.C. We have to go back to pre-COVID levels. That\\'s why I\\'ll veto any spending bill that doesn\\'t take us back to pre-COVID levels. That will save us trillions. We\\'ve got to go into every agency, replace the head of every agency and send people into every agency.</p>\\n<p>I did that as governor. Pull down old regs, pull down old programs, get rid of any problem children and clean those agencies out and get them mission-focused. There is a lot of waste in D.C. You need an accountant to go in there and clean it up. But we\\'re not going to take away from anyone else and he\\'s yet to answer the fact that he voted three times to raise the retirement age.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Just a clarification, Governor Haley, in 15 seconds, should voters in their 20s plan on having to work until they\\'re 70?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> They should plan on their retirement age being increased, yes. We\\'re going to change it to reflect more of what life expectancy should be.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, one of the things that I think we disagree on, too, is Governor Haley has said Social Security is an entitlement, but it\\'s not an entitlement. You\\'re paying into it. It\\'s not a welfare program. You\\'re being taxed for this your whole life. And so to expect to have benefits on the backend, I don\\'t think that that\\'s too much.</p>\\n<p>The other thing I\\'d point out is Social Security for decades ran massive surpluses. What happened to those surpluses? The Congress spent the surpluses.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Yes, when you paid the debt.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They have a big problem with that. So, number one, we need term limits for members of Congress. Number two, we need a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Number three, we need to give the president a line item veto. And, number four, when you see all these Congressmen making a killing in the stock market, like Nancy Pelosi, she could run a very lucrative hedge fund, we need a 28th Amendment to the Constitution that says very simply Congress shall make no law respecting the citizens of the United States that does not also apply to members of Congress themselves.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> I want to turn now to the topic abortion, which, of course, has been hotly debated in this Republican primary campaign.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, last week Governor DeSantis said that former President Trump is not pro-life. Do you agree?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, look, I think that he did some pro-life things when he was president. You\\'d have to ask him. That\\'s why he should be on this debate stage.</p>\\n<p>Don\\'t ask me what President Trump thinks. You need to have him on this debate stage and ask him for yourself.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, look, I think that we\\'ve stood very strongly for a culture of life. Governor Reynolds is here. She has stood strongly for a culture of life and a national life protection. We\\'ve done it in the state of Florida. Donald Trump has attacked that.</p>\\n<p>What they did under Governor Reynolds here in Iowa, he said that that\\'s a, quote, terrible, terrible thing. I don\\'t know how you square that. He was at the March for Life when he was president his last year and he said that life\\'s a gift from God, that the unborn are made in the image of God and that you needed to have protections for that human life. And now saying it\\'s a terrible, terrible thing, he\\'s given a gift to the left to weaponize that against pro-lifers, and that\\'s wrong.</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the thing. Republicans need to do a better job of lifting up folks who are having children. It\\'s very difficult to raise kids in this environment. You need the help with medical care. You need the help with affordability, and we need the help with education, choice. You got to be pro-life for the whole life, and you got to have some compassion for what is going on in this country.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. Oh, I\\'m sorry. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor, yesterday in Iowa, you criticized Governor Haley on this issue of abortion. You said she\\'s, quote, indulged in left wing tropes and chastised pro-lifers. Do you believe Governor Haley is sufficiently pro-life?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think she\\'s been confused on the issue. I think she\\'s trying to speak to different groups with different things. But when she says things like pro-lifers need to stop talking about throwing women in jail, that\\'s a trope. No one I\\'ve ever met thinks that that\\'s something that\\'s appropriate. These women are in vulnerable situations. They don\\'t get any help a lot of times from these fathers who don\\'t want to be there supportive. A lot of times they don\\'t have resources themselves.</p>\\n<p>So, it\\'s a very difficult situation and we\\'ve got to have compassion for those situations. But I think when she starts bringing that in, that\\'s using the language of the left to try to attack pro-lifers.</p>\\n<p>So, I think that that is wrong. But at the end of the day, I do agree with her on this. Donald Trump should be on this stage. He owes it to you here in Iowa to explain this change he\\'s had in his positioning, to explain why he has a tough time saying whether a man can become a woman or not, to explain why he wants to build a billion dollar-plus big, beautiful, new FBI building right in the heart of the swamp in Washington, D.C. He needs to explain why he didn\\'t build the wall and why he added $7.8 trillion to the debt.</p>\\n<p>Every candidate needs to earn your vote. Nobody is entitled to your vote. And he comes in here every now and then, he does his spiel, and then he leaves. I\\'ve shown up to all 99 counties because it\\'s important. You\\'re a servant of the people. You are not a ruler over the people. And that\\'s the type of president that I will be for you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I didn\\'t hear the criticism from Ron about me for being pro- life, but I\\'m not surprised. It\\'s something that he does all day, every day. I am unapologetically pro-life, not because the Republican Party tells me to be, but because my husband is adopted and I\\'ve got my two sweet children sitting in front of me and I had trouble having both of them.</p>\\n<p>These fellows don\\'t know how to talk about abortion. I have said over and over again, the Democrats put fear in women on abortion and Republicans have used judgment. This is too personal of an issue to put fear or judgment.</p>\\n<p>Our goal should be how do we save as many babies as possible and support as many moms as possible. That\\'s what we\\'re going to focus on doing. We\\'re not going to demonize this issue anymore. We\\'re not going to play politics with this issue anymore. We\\'re going to treat it like the respectful issue that it is.</p>\\n<p>And the tropes that you want to talk about, you keep saying, where is anybody talking about putting a woman in jail or giving her the death penalty? South Carolina. There is legislation right now that would put a woman in jail if she got an abortion. That\\'s why I say that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>So, I do want to remind the viewers at home, both governors have mentioned that they believe that Donald Trump should be here defending his own record. I just want to remind everybody that he did qualify for this debate and he did not accept our invitation.</p>\\n<p>Both of you talked about how important it is to protect the U.S. Constitution. Two years after losing the 2020 election, Donald Trump wrote on social media about his baseless election lies, quote, a massive fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution, unquote. On that subject, former Vice President Mike Pence has said that on January 6th, 2021, Donald Trump put himself over the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, look, you take an oath to the Constitution, and I think what you\\'re seeing is Donald Trump basically said that the election was stolen. He went on and on talking about the election being stolen.</p>\\n<p>He said that January 6th was a beautiful day. I think January 6th was a terrible day and we should never want to see that happen again.</p>\\n<p>And I think we have to always be strong on the fact that, look, we want fair elections and we saw some discrepancies in those elections in 2020 that should be concerning. That\\'s why I passed voter I.D. in South Carolina. That\\'s why I think when absentee ballots go out, you should be able to verify signatures. That\\'s why I think ballots need to be counted on Election Day and you should get results on Election Day.</p>\\n<p>But that election, Trump lost it. Biden won that election. And the idea that he\\'s gone and carried this out forever to the point that he\\'s going to continue to say these things to scare the American people are wrong. We\\'ve seen a lot of states come together and do more election integrity bills. We need to do more than that. We still have three or four states that I\\'m worried about that don\\'t have that.</p>\\n<p>But at the end of the day, I will always defend and fight for the Constitution. That\\'s what we should do as Americans. I think what happened on January 6th was a terrible day and I think President Trump will have to answer for it.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, just a clarification, Governor, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I mean, I think that he says in January 6th was a beautiful day. I don\\'t think it was a beautiful day. I think you look at that. He thinks that he could go and bring in -- the fact that he wanted to change what the states did, the fact that he wanted to overturn the elections in D.C., those votes happen at the state level. You don\\'t ever allow in D.C. for those votes to be changed at the federal level.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> States rights matter.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> My role model for how to do the Constitution is George Washington. He said, the Constitution is the guide that I will never abandon. And I remember when I took an oath to be an officer in the U.S. Navy. You raise that hand, you put that left hand on the Bible. And it\\'s interesting, the oath doesn\\'t say that you\\'re going to defend the shores of the United States or engage in military conflict.</p>\\n<p>The oath simply says that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States. As President of the United States, you will preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. You can\\'t just terminate the Constitution. I mean, I know he does word vomit from time to time on social media, but, obviously, I will uphold the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>And I think it\\'s fine to criticize Donald Trump, and I know the media brings it up a lot. But you know who else deserves to be criticized? The people that violated the Constitution during COVID to lock people out of schools, to destroy businesses, to force masks on people, to try to force vaccines. I\\'m going to bring a reckoning to all these agencies, the CDC, the NIH, the FDA, they harm people in this country. And when Dr. Fauci said there was no learning loss for kids, that\\'s a disgrace.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> There\\'s a reckoning coming.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, let\\'s talk about how you view the powers of the presidency because your opponent, Donald Trump, was in court yesterday for a hearing on presidential immunity. And, Governor DeSantis, I\\'m wondering if you agree with the argument that Donald Trump\\'s lawyer made in court that a president should have immunity for any conduct in office, including, as the judge asked, ordering the assassination of a political rival unless the president gets impeached and convicted by the Senate for the offense first.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, obviously, that attorney gave the case away on that explanation. I think the D.C. Circuit is going to rule against Donald Trump on that issue. I\\'m not exactly sure what the outer limits are. I don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily been litigated. It\\'s not going to be an issue with me, because I\\'m always going to follow the Constitution. And we\\'re going to uphold the best traditions of the office. And I\\'m going to be a president you can be proud of.</p>\\n<p>I think it\\'s important that people would be able to look to the president and say, hey, that\\'s somebody that\\'s worthy of emulating. And so my wife and I, we just view ourselves to try to do well for our kids and to make sure they\\'re proud of us. And we set a good example. So, that\\'s what we would do in that situation.</p>\\n<p>But I think there\\'s a larger issue Republicans have got to think of. Donald Trump is going to lose that appeal. He\\'s going to end up going to trial in front of a stacked left-wing D.C. jury of all Democrats. What are the odds that he\\'s going to get through that? And that\\'s even talking about the validity of the charges. I don\\'t think he gets through that.</p>\\n<p>And so what are we going to do as Republicans in terms of who we nominate for president? If Trump is the nominee, it\\'s going to be about January 6th, legal issues, criminal trials. The Democrats and the media would love to run with that.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m not running for my issues. I\\'m running for your issues. We need to make this election a referendum on the failures of Joe Biden, the failures of the Democratic Party, and how we have the formula to engineer a great comeback for this country. That\\'s what I would do.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley, Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t hear the question.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> The question was, do you agree with the argument Donald Trump\\'s lawyer made in court that a president should have immunity for any conduct, including ordering the assassination of a political rival unless that president is impeached and convicted by Senate for the defense first?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> No, that\\'s ridiculous. That\\'s absolutely ridiculous. I mean, we need to use some common sense here. You can\\'t go and kill a political rival and then claim, you know, immunity from a President. I think we have to start doing things that are right. And you know,</p>\\n<p>Ron said we should have leaders that we can look up to. Well, then stop lying because nobody\\'s going to want to look up to you if you\\'re lying.</p>\\n<p>But what I do think we need to look at is what is what has President Trump done? You look at the last few years and our country is completely divided. It\\'s divided over extremes. It\\'s divided over hatred, it\\'s divided over the fact that people think that if someone doesn\\'t agree with you that they\\'re bad.</p>\\n<p>And now we have leaders in our country that decide who\\'s good and who\\'s bad, who\\'s right and who\\'s wrong. That\\'s not what a leader does. What a leader does is they bring out the best in people and get them to see the way forward.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s what we need in our country. We don\\'t need this chaos anymore. We need someone who\\'s going to be a new generational leader that brings sanity back to America.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you so much. We\\'ll see you then. Republican Presidential Debate live from Drake University. We\\'ll be back right after this.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Iowa, Drake University. Let\\'s start this with health care. Neither of you has released a detailed healthcare plan so we want to give some -- the voters here some insight into specifics of what you might do as President.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, as governor of South Carolina you chose not to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. Forty states including this one where we are in Iowa did expand Medicaid covering more than 18 million Americans. As President, would you allow those states to keep their expansions in place?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, the first thing is we have to look at the fact that how can we be the best country in the world with the most expensive health care in the world? And so the way we\\'re going to deal with it is we\\'re going to open it all up from the hospitals to the insurance companies to the doctor\\'s offices to the pharmaceuticals to the PBMs, make them have to show us everything.</p>\\n<p>Because right now, I can tell you, we take care of my parents. They\\'re 87 and 90. My dad is in the hospital right now. When my mom was in the hospital, a nurse came up to her to give her a couple of Tylenol. And she said, I don\\'t need them. And she said, honey, you might as well take them, because you\\'re going to pay for them anyway. When we got the bill from the hospital, no one talked to us about that.</p>\\n<p>Right now, you have insurance companies and hospitals deciding what it is for us. We\\'re going to take the patient out of the back seat and put them in the driver\\'s seat. We\\'re going to make sure that just like when you get your car fixed, and you go and they say, we can give you a temporary fix, and it\\'ll cost this much money, or we can give you a permanent fix, and it\\'s going to cost that much money. We\\'re going to go and make it transparent so that we can see everything so that they have to show us their words.</p>\\n<p>The second thing is we\\'re going to pass Tort Reform around this country. I did that in South Carolina. Doctors don\\'t give you those 10 tests because they want to. It\\'s for the 90 percent chance they\\'ll get sued. And then we\\'re going to go and eliminate Certificate of Need in this country. I did that in South Carolina, as well. That basically says if you have a hospital here, you can\\'t have another hospital for X number of miles.</p>\\n<p>They do the same thing for surgical centers, for nursing homes. We\\'re going to put competition back in health care so that health care is fighting for the patient. That way, services go up and costs go down.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor Haley, just a 15-second point of clarification. Would you allow the states that accepted Medicaid expansion to keep that?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, the problem with Medicaid is, it needs to be sent down as block grants. Governors can best decide how to do that. Whether they need to use it towards mental health, whether they need to use it towards support services.</p>\\n<p>Right now, I would send all of that down to the states. The problem is they\\'re only sending a small portion of it. They need to send more of that so that states can better take care of it.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis, your response on whether you would allow Iowa and the other 39 states who accepted Medicaid expansion to keep it.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I\\'ve spoken with a lot of folks here in Iowa, and we need health care that\\'s accessible, that\\'s affordable, and that\\'s accountable. And particularly an emphasis on mental health. In every corner of this state, everywhere I\\'ve traveled in the campaign, people are really concerned about mental health with the kids in schools, people that are coming out of service to our country, with veterans, we\\'re going to put a big emphasis on mental health.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve actually delivered on some of these things in Florida. We got accountability for the pharmacy benefit middlemen that are causing your drug prices to go up. So, we have transparency and consumers pay less. And I just beat the federal government to allow the state of Florida to buy prescription drugs from Canada, which is 25 cents on the dollar. What are prescription drugs cost? I want seniors to be able to do.</p>\\n<p>And then finally, we need to upend this COVID and medical authoritarian regime that we saw going around this country during COVID. It\\'s wrong to force vaxes like the COVID shot and say people are going to lose their jobs. That is not going to ever happen on my watch, trust me.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, same. Fifteen-second clarification.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think what you do is you block-grant the program and then let states run the way they see fit to do. But I can tell you this, expanding Medicaid leads to less private coverage. It doesn\\'t necessarily increase access to quality care. I want to actually get people good health care. It\\'s not just about a sheet of paper if you don\\'t get any good doctors that get you entitled for that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor DeSantis mentioned mental health. Let\\'s talk about that. There is a mental health crisis in this country. An estimated 58 million Americans suffer from some type of mental health illness. Governor Haley, you say the mental health crisis is a quote, \"cancer that no one has dealt with\". What do you think is causing the crisis and what would you do to fix it?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think we saw it exacerbated by COVID. I mean with the school lockdowns and everything else we see young people now with more anxiety, stress and depression than ever before. One in three people right now suffer from mental health issues, but if treated, they can live a perfectly normal life.</p>\\n<p>The problem is we don\\'t have enough mental health therapists. We don\\'t have enough mental health treatment centers. We don\\'t have enough addiction centers. And if you happen to be lucky enough to get one of those three, insurance doesn\\'t cover it.</p>\\n<p>We have got to start dealing with this, because it\\'s become a huge issue. And that\\'s why we need to have more Telehealth, so that people can get the mental health care they need right when they need it. We need to have mental health counselors in schools so they can identify when a child has a problem that they can get the help that they need. But right now, we\\'ve got to get access to care. And that\\'s, again, why I want to move those federal programs down to the state level, because states know they need more mental health support.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re not getting the dollars to do it. We don\\'t need D.C. bureaucrats handling that. We need this on the ground so that we can get the mental health centers, get the therapists, and get the help that people need so that they can be healthy again.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, you said right here in Iowa this summer that closing mental health institutions, a policy supported by Ronald Reagan, was a mistake. As President, would you restore federal funding to those mental health institutions?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yes, we need more people in institutionalized settings, unfortunately. But, you know, Governor Haley mentioned, I think, correctly, the devastating mental health consequences for these school closures, a lot of things that happened during COVID, I never recalled seeing her out there fighting the fight. I was on the front lines on that. Governor Kim Reynolds was on the front lines on that.</p>\\n<p>We fought back against the biomedical state. We were attacked by the media. We were attacked by the pharmaceutical companies. We were attacked by the left, attacked by Fauci. We stood and we helped people. And Iowa and Florida had the best schools opening in the entire pandemic because we led. That\\'s what you want to do.</p>\\n<p>Now, in terms of mental health, I\\'ve run into veterans here in Iowa, and I think we have a significant problem with veterans, particularly the post-9-11 veterans, and we know the stats on suicide. It\\'s really, really sad. And as a fellow veteran, as President, I have to put that issue on the front burner.</p>\\n<p>We can\\'t keep turning a blind eye to what\\'s happening to our vets. It\\'s not going to be done just through the VA. And it can\\'t be done just by pumping people with pharmaceuticals. If a veteran has post- traumatic stress, you need more than just that. So, we\\'re going to use the VA to link veterans with resources that are throughout our country.</p>\\n<p>For example, in Florida, we have an organization that trains service dogs to be able to be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. They understand the symptoms, they mitigate it, and you know what? The suicide rate is close to zero as a result of that. We got to think bigger than these bureaucracies, and we\\'ve got to be there for our vets and their mental health.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Turning -- turning to the topic of climate, 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded on Earth, and Americans are already feeling the impact. Just yesterday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the U.S. experienced 28 weather and climate-related disasters that cost at least $1 billion last year -- another record.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, here in Florida. I\\'m sorry, Governor DeSantis, here in Iowa, massive flooding has left farmers underwater. In Florida, rising seas threaten coastal cities. You have taken action in your home state to mitigate the problems of rising seas. But as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So, on day one as President, we take Biden\\'s Green New Deal. We tear it up and we throw it in the trash can. It is bad for this country. We have to have reliable energy. And here\\'s the thing, you know, they talk about -- Joe Biden has said that global warming is worse than a nuclear war. And I\\'m just thinking to myself, well, gee, John Kerry hasn\\'t given up his private jet. Obama hasn\\'t given up his Martha\\'s Vineyard seaside mansion. I haven\\'t seen Biden do anything to hold China accountable except making sure that Hunter gets his money.</p>\\n<p>So, these guys talk out of one side of their mouth and then they behave in another way. And I think that\\'s wrong. But I also think that those policies would devastate communities, particularly here in Iowa. I mean, for example, he wants to mandate electric vehicles. That\\'s going to be more costly.</p>\\n<p>I think the car companies would go bankrupt, but it\\'s going to hurt liquid fuels, which is very, very important. You\\'re going to end up having rolling blackouts if they kneecap reliable energy production in this country. Florida\\'s had a massive decline in emissions -- wasn\\'t because of a single mandate.</p>\\n<p>It was because of innovation, because a lot of natural gas has replaced coal. We do have market-based solar, and it\\'s a compliment, but we cannot walk away from reliable energy. And I think about, here\\'s what the left wants to do. They want to take away your freedom, and they want you to pay more for everything.</p>\\n<p>We need you to pay less for energy. And we need to make sure people can innovate. We cannot have these mandates and they\\'ll be gone the day I\\'m President.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, Governor, just a point of clarification -- 15 seconds. A recent research at the University of Iowa ties these floods in Iowa to the rise in greenhouse gases.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And here\\'s the thing, Jake, I appreciate that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Let me just ask the question. As President, would you do anything to deal with this underlying cause?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Innovate, and here\\'s the thing. China is building two coal plants a week. You can do everything Biden wants to do and you\\'re going to have way more of what China\\'s increasing it. So, why would we be cutting off our nose to spite our face? China is the problem here, and so hold them accountable.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But don\\'t hold the American people to less opportunity.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley, as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause of the floods and other climate disasters, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, first of all, regardless of what party, everybody wants to have clean air, clean water. They want a world that they can pass on to their kids that\\'s going to be healthy and all of that. But it\\'s how do we do that? I think the first thing we have to understand is you don\\'t deal in extremes.</p>\\n<p>When I was at the United Nations, the reason I took us out of the Paris climate agreement was because President Obama had put all these mandates down on our businesses, but they didn\\'t do anything to hold China and India to account. Those are the two countries we have to really go to if we care about the environment, that we go and make them be held accountable.</p>\\n<p>The second thing is we\\'ll roll back all of Biden\\'s green subsidies because they\\'re misplaced. Rather than putting anything towards innovation on what we can do on nuclear fusion and other things that reduce emissions, which there are things out there, to go and have everybody have to drive an electric car by 2035. That\\'s not even smart. One, because which, by the way, Ron took Biden\\'s stimulus money and did charging stations all throughout Florida. I wouldn\\'t have taken the stimulus money. But what that does is basically, we don\\'t have the infrastructure. And I\\'m not just talking about charging stations. Electric vehicles are heavy. Our roads and bridges wouldn\\'t be able to handle that if we did that because they\\'re heavy in weight.</p>\\n<p>And so we have to be smart about the way we do that. Not to mention 70 percent of the batteries in electric cars are made in China. So, Biden gave this massive windfall to our number one national security threat. If we\\'re going to do it, innovate it, transition and do it the right way, not in extremes.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. I want to turn to the issue of crime. The majority of Americans describe crime in the U.S. as either extremely or very serious. Recent data show crime rates falling, but some violent crime rates do remain high. Governor Haley, former President Trump, suggested that he might try to stop violent crime by deploying U.S. troops to democratic-run states and cities, something he could potentially do under the Insurrection Act. Is that something that you would do as President?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> What I would do is, first of all, defund sanctuary cities. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. That\\'s where we\\'re seeing a lot of crime. But the second thing is, our law enforcement is demoralized right now. Because if they go and they arrest someone for having a stolen gun, it\\'s demoralizing when they go through all that effort, put their lives at risk, and then you turn around and let that criminal go the very next day.</p>\\n<p>Prosecutors need to prosecute according to the law and we\\'ve got to start holding them accountable. When we bring law and order back to our cities, then that\\'s when they\\'ll be safe. You don\\'t do it by defunding the police, and you don\\'t do it by just praising the police.</p>\\n<p>You do it by having their backs, making sure we pass the first Body Camera Bill in the country in South Carolina, to make sure that law enforcement felt like they could do their job without anyone -- without feeling threatened about them doing their job.</p>\\n<p>But we have to have prosecutors prosecuting. We have to defund sanctuary cities. We have to get these stolen guns and drugs off the street. And the only way we can do that is when we empower law enforcement.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I just think, I mean, that quote from the President, former president Trump is a little bit rich because he was President during the worst rioting in the modern history of this country, the BLM riots in the summer of 2020. When I saw that happening in Minneapolis, in Florida, I called out the National Guard. We had state law enforcement deployed.</p>\\n<p>We said, you\\'re not burning down our cities in this state. And you know what? It didn\\'t happen. He sat in the White House and tweeted law and order, but he did nothing to ensure law and order. As your President, I will never let our cities burn. You have every right to stop this runaway rioting as President. In fact, you have a duty.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley and I have a disagreement on the BLM stuff, too, because she tweeted during this period of time that the death of George Floyd should be, quote, \"personal and painful for each and every American\".</p>\\n<p>But people in Iowa had nothing to do with that, or Florida or South Carolina, she was virtue signaling to the left, she was accepting the narrative, and she was trying to impress people who were never going to like us.</p>\\n<p>I never bought in to going after the police, we backed the Blue to the state of Florida, and we\\'re about lower crime as a result of that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s interesting that he did that. He put a tweet that was very similar.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That\\'s not true.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> But let me tell you why I did that. First of all, we had one of the worst racial shootings. We had the shooting of Walter Scott who was shot seven times in the back by a dirty cop. We had a horrific shooting at a church where a white supremacist came in and killed nine amazing souls.</p>\\n<p>BLM, all of that, we never had to deal with riots. We never had to call in the National Guard, Ron, because when we had both of those shootings, we were able to pull people together. We didn\\'t have riots, we had vigils. We didn\\'t have protests, we had prayer. We brought people together.</p>\\n<p>When I said that about George Floyd, when we turned around and had the worst shooting in a religious place that we had seen in this country, not only did I pass the first Body Camera Bill in the country and keep our state together, not only did I move to bring the Confederate flag down, we came together as a state in prayer --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- and we had no division, no riots, no anything.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> We didn\\'t need the National Guard because a leader knows how to bring out the best of the people.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. So, you have been sparring on the campaign trail for months. We\\'ve seen some vicious attack ads going back and forth, and tonight we have had a very lively debate. On a different note, Governor DeSantis, let me ask you, what do you admire about Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, look, I mean, I think that, you know, at the United Nations, I did think that she spoke out strongly on some key issues, and I appreciated that. I also appreciate the state of South Carolina. My wife is a College of Charleston graduate. Her parents lived there for many, many years.</p>\\n<p>And so, it is a wonderful state. There\\'s a lot of great people there. And I think to be able to have been Governor there is a great achievement. And I really appreciate everyone I\\'ve gotten to meet in South Carolina.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, what do you admire about Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think he\\'s been a good governor.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Okay. So, we\\'re going to squeeze in another quick break. And we\\'ll be right back with more from the Republican debates here at Drake University.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re back live from Des Moines, Iowa in the CNN Republican Presidential Debate. We now have time for closing statements and we begin with Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, I want to thank the good people of Iowa. I have campaigned for 11 months, whether it\\'s driving a combine or holding a pig at a produce area or whether it\\'s the fact that we\\'ve met owners of bakeries and small businesses.</p>\\n<p>You know, every one of them knows that we can\\'t go through four more years of chaos. And if it\\'s Donald Trump, there will be four more years of chaos. And we can\\'t be a country in disarray in a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. And we can\\'t go through another nail-biter of an election.</p>\\n<p>And if you look at the polls right now, going against Joe Biden, in every one of those head-to-head polls, Ron doesn\\'t beat Joe Biden. Trump is head-to-head. On a good day, he might be up by two points. I defeat Biden by 17 points. That\\'s bigger than the presidency.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s House, that\\'s Senate, that\\'s governorships, that\\'s down to school board. That\\'s a mandate to get our spending under control and get inflation down. That\\'s a mandate to get our kids reading again and go back to the basics in education. That\\'s a mandate to secure our borders with no more excuses. That\\'s a mandate to bring law and order back to our country and that\\'s a mandate for a strong America that we can be proud of.</p>\\n<p>We can do this. I know we can do this. If you will join with me in this movement, if you join with me in this fight, I promise you our best days are to come. God bless you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, it\\'s been great to visit all 99 counties here in Iowa. I\\'ve been able to meet so many friends and really learn about some of the best of America. Iowa\\'s votes do not need to be corrected by any other state. You all know what you\\'re doing. And we have an opportunity on Monday to really change the course of history.</p>\\n<p>Donald Trump\\'s running for his issues. Nikki Haley\\'s running for her donors\\' issues. I\\'m running for your issues, your family\\'s issues, and solely to turn this country around. I\\'m the only one running that\\'s delivered on 100 percent of my promises. And I\\'m the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again, from the teachers\\' unions, to Fauci, to the Democratic Party.</p>\\n<p>We need to run under the banner of bold colors that are putting the American people first. We can\\'t run under a banner of pale pastels of the warmed-over corporatism, the likes of which is practiced by Nikki Haley. Freedom is on the ballot. Decline is a choice. We have it within our power to fix this country and to turn it around.</p>\\n<p>I am asking for your support in the Iowa caucus on Monday, January 15th. I\\'ll be a President that you can be proud of and I promise you this, I will get the job done and I will not let you down. Thank you and God bless you all.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Our thanks to Governor DeSantis and Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis and Governor Haley, thank you so much both of you for being here tonight. Thanks to our audience, to our host, Drake University. For Dana Bash and the whole CNN team, I\\'m Jake Tapper. Thank you so much for watching. Be sure to join us Monday, January 15th at 4 P.M. Eastern for CNN\\'s coverage of the Iowa caucuses. Anderson Cooper and Kaitlan Collins are going to pick it up right now with more on the debate.

(CNN); and<br />Jake Tapper (CNN)</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Live from Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa, this is the CNN Republican presidential debate.</p>\\n<p>We want to welcome our viewers in the United States and around the world watching us on CNN, CNN Max, CNN International, CNN en Espanol, and CNN.com.</p>\\n<p>Good evening. I\\'m Jake Tapper, moderating tonight\\'s debate alongside my friend and colleague Dana Bash.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> And just five days from now, voters here in Iowa will cast the first votes of the 2024 presidential race.</p>\\n<p>Tonight, the very first one-on-one matchup between top contenders Governor Ron DeSantis and former Governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Former President Trump met the requirements for tonight\\'s debate, but declined to participate.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Our commitment in this debate is to provide as much information as possible to voters, especially here in Iowa, before the first contests begin next week.</p>\\n<p>So, in choosing topics, we focused on the issues important to Republicans.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s bring out the candidates now.</p>\\n<p>Please welcome Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Please welcome former South Carolina Governor and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Candidates, please take your positions behind the podiums while we remind you and our audience of the ground rules.</p>\\n<p>Each of you will have 90 seconds to answer questions, 60 seconds for responses and rebuttals, and 15 seconds for clarifications. Timing lights will remind you when time is expiring.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> We also remind our audience here in the Sheslow Auditorium at Drake University to be respectful, so the candidates can hear the questions and can hear each other.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Just hours ago, the Republican field narrowed once again. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie ended his bid for the presidency.</p>\\n<p>So, with one fewer candidate in the running, let\\'s start with the decision voters here in Iowa are about to face.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, why should voters who are looking for an alternative to the current front-runner, former President Trump, vote for you, rather than former Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, to people of Iowa, good evening. It\\'s great to be in Iowa to have a debate here.</p>\\n<p>Donald Trump\\'s running to pursue his issues. Nikki Haley\\'s running to pursue her donors\\' issues. I\\'m running to pursue your issues and your family\\'s issues and to turn this country around. I\\'m the only one running that\\'s delivered on 100 percent of the promises that I have made.</p>\\n<p>We have delivered huge victories in the state of Florida, things that Republicans have been asking for, for a generation. I\\'m also the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again. We beat the teachers union on universal school choice. We beat Soros on crime. We beat Fauci on COVID. We beat the Dems on election integrity. And I beat the left by banning China from buying land in the state of Florida.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley is running. We don\\'t need another mealymouthed politician who just tells you what she thinks you want to hear just to try to get your vote, then to get in office and to do her donors\\' bidding.</p>\\n<p>She was in another state, and she said the people of Iowa\\'s votes need to be corrected. This is somebody that wrote in her book that Hillary Clinton inspired her to first run for office.</p>\\n<p>I remember Hillary denigrating people on the Republican side as deplorables. We don\\'t need a candidate who\\'s going to look down on Middle America. We have had enough of that. I\\'m the only one that\\'s going to be able to lead this country\\'s revival.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m asking for your support, and I won\\'t let you down.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, a response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think this is a time that we know that we need a new generational leader.</p>\\n<p>We have watched our country be in disarray. We see the world on fire, and we need someone who\\'s had executive experience. I have been a two- term governor that took a double-digit unemployment state and turned it into an economic powerhouse. I was at the U.N. I dealt with Russia, China, Iran every day.</p>\\n<p>But, you\\'re going to find out tonight that there is going to be a lot of Ron\\'s lies that has happened. There are at least a couple of dozen so far that he has done. So, what we\\'re going to do is rather than have him go and tell you all these lies, you can go to DeSantislies.com and look at all of those. There is at least two dozen lies that he has told about me, and you can see where a fact checker say exactly what\\'s going to happen and exactly why it\\'s wrong.</p>\\n<p>So, it will cover the fact that he is only mad about the donors because the donors used to be with him, but they\\'re no longer with him now. And that\\'s because he is upset about the fact that his campaign is exploding. You\\'re going to see the fact that he has switched his policies multiple times, and we\\'ll call that out tonight. But, every time he lies, Drake University, don\\'t turn this into a drinking game, because you will be overserved by the end of the night.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I think this is interesting, because you can actually go to RonDesantis.com, because Nikki Haley has this tactic. If you hold her accountable to her record, first she\\'ll say, I never said that. Well, one good rule of thumb, if she says she has never said something, that definitely means she said it, and then she\\'ll say you\\'re lying, you\\'re lying. That means not only did she say it but she is on videotape saying it. And so, we have all the greatest hits. The reality is Nikki Haley is not somebody that has been willing to stand in and fight on behalf of conservatives.</p>\\n<p>You know, she ran for governor saying she was going to do universal school choice, and she caved to the teachers union. She didn\\'t deliver that. In Florida, I delivered the largest expansion of school choice in the history of the United States. I beat the teachers union, and you know what the results are? When she was governor of South Carolina, she was rated 50th in education, dead last. You know, where Florida is under my watch, number one in the nation.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Your response, Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Go to DeSantislies.com and you can find out for yourself. But, why don\\'t we talk about the fact that if we\\'re going to say this, when Ron was representing Florida, he said that he promised not to raise the debt limit when he got to D.C. Yet, he raised the debt limit by hundreds of billions of dollars. He used to support Ukraine. He supported Ukraine when President Obama was in office. Now, he is trying to copy Trump and saying that he no longer supports Ukraine, and doesn\\'t want to give them foreign aid anymore. He also goes and says that he wants to talk about me insulting Iowans. Iowans know when you\\'re telling a joke.</p>\\n<p>The fact that he is only running in one state is not the way you win President. I\\'m running it all states. But, he should tell Iowans why he authored legislation to ban the renewable fuel standard that\\'s so important to Iowans\\' economy, and the fact that he co-sponsored five different pieces of legislation to get rid of it. And also, then he also said he would never do anything with Social Security. Yet, he voted three times to raise the retirement age of Social Security.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, if you\\'re going to talk about what you said --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- and you did, I think you\\'ve got your own explaining to do --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Well, we\\'re going to --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- rather than telling lies about --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> -- well, thank you, Governor. We\\'re going to get to a lot of these issues in the debate. Governor Haley, when Governor Christie dropped out of the race just a few hours ago, he said the most important issue is \"the character of the candidate\". Governor Christie also said he ran because he knew he would be the only Republican candidate to speak the truth about former President Donald Trump. Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be President again?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think the next President needs to have moral clarity. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that it\\'s taxpayer money, not your own money. I think you need to have moral clarity to understand that when you\\'re dealing with dictators in the world, that we always have to fight for democracies and human rights and protecting Americans and preventing war.</p>\\n<p>And so, when you look at Donald Trump, I have said, I think he was the right President at the right time. I agree with a lot of his policies, but his way is not my way. I don\\'t have vengeance. I don\\'t have vendettas. I don\\'t take things personally. For me, it\\'s very much about no drama, no whining and getting results and getting them done. So, I don\\'t think that President Trump is the right President to go forward. I think it\\'s time for a new generational leader that\\'s going to go and make America proud again. That\\'s what I\\'m going to try and do.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, what is your response to Chris Christie? Do you believe Donald Trump has the character to be President again?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I\\'m running because I\\'m the guy that\\'s going to be able to engineer a comeback for this country. I appreciated what President Trump did. But, let\\'s just be honest. He said he was going to build a wall and have Mexico pay for it. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to drain the swamp. He did not deliver that. He said he was going to hold Hillary accountable and he let her off the hook. He said he was going to eliminate the debt and he added $7.8 trillion to the debt. So, we need to deliver and get this stuff done.</p>\\n<p>And I think the difference between Nikki Haley and me, and I listened to all that litany of stuff, I debated the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom. I thought he lied a lot. Man, Nikki Haley made -- gives him a run for his money and she may even be more liberal than Gavin Newsom is. We are in a situation here in Florida.</p>\\n<p>And as Republicans, you need somebody that is going to be in there and fight for you. And Nikki Haley, any time the going gets tough, any time people come down, she caves. When you need someone standing and fight for you, don\\'t look for Nikki Haley. You won\\'t be able to find her if you had a search warrant. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Look, I think I dealt with Russia, China, Iran, North Korea every day. No one ever said I caved. I defended America and I fought for America. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>But I\\'ll also say this. This is not a time where you have to have pettiness. I wish Donald Trump was up here on this stage. He\\'s the one that I\\'m running against. He\\'s the one that I wish would be here. He needs to be defending his record. Right now he\\'s not defending the fact that he allowed us to have $8 trillion in debt over four years that our kids are never going to forgive us for. The fact that he didn\\'t deal with China when it came to stealing intellectual property. The fact that they gave us COVID. The fact that they have gone and continued to put up Chinese police stations and continue to threaten our military.</p>\\n<p>He didn\\'t do enough to make sure that we were really standing with our friends and doing some other things. What we need is a leader that\\'s not looking at four years and eight years. We need a president that\\'s looking at 20 and 30 years. Because I want my kids to have a good future. I want them to have one without debt, one where they can read, one with secure borders, one where we have law and order, and one where America is strong.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, with all due respect, you know, for her to single out Donald Trump on China, and, look, I think he could have been tougher on them, 100 percent. When Nikki Haley was governor of South Carolina, she was the number one governor in America for Republicans of bringing China into her state. She wrote a love letter to the ambassador saying that they were a great friend. She is on video saying China is a friend. She had a business, five -- Chinese business five miles from a military base. There is video of her on the website right in front of a Chinese flag saying that she works for them now.</p>\\n<p>So that was her number one achievement as governor was bringing China into the state of South Carolina. So you say you\\'re going to look 10, 20, 30 years down the road? Why wasn\\'t she doing that then when people were raising the red flags about it?</p>\\n<p>In Florida, I banned China from buying land in our state.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Yes, but, Governor DeSantis...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And we kicked them out of our universities. That\\'s what you need to be doing. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re going to talk about China in a little bit. I want to talk about the economy, which according to a recent Des Moines Register poll shows that the economy is the top issue for caucus-goers here.</p>\\n<p>So, Governor Haley, the rate of inflation is down. Prices, though, are still high, and Americans are struggling to afford food, cars, and housing. What is the single most important policy that you would implement as president to make the essentials in Americans\\' lives more important?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think we have to acknowledge that Republicans and Democrats have both done this. I mean, the fact that they\\'ve done all of this wasteful spending, they did a $2.2 trillion COVID stimulus bill that expanded welfare that\\'s now left us with 80 million Americans on Medicaid, 42 million Americans on food stamps. That\\'s a third of our country.</p>\\n<p>What I will do is I think it\\'s time we have an accountant in the White House. We have to have someone that respects taxpayer dollars. And we\\'ll start by clawing back $100 billion of unspent COVID dollars that are still out there.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ll go and instead of 87,000 IRS agents going after middle America, we\\'ll go after the hundreds of billions of dollars of COVID fraud, 1 out of every $7. If 8 percent of our budget is interest, quit borrowing. Cut up the credit cards.</p>\\n<p>I had to balance a budget as governor. You have to balance a budget every day. Why is Congress the only group that refuses to balance a budget? We\\'ll stop the spending. We\\'ll stop the borrowing. We\\'ll eliminate the pet projects and the earmarks. And I\\'ll veto any spending bill that doesn\\'t take us back to pre-COVID levels.</p>\\n<p>And then we want to make sure that we allow the middle class to breathe. We\\'re going to eliminate the federal gas and diesel tax in this country and cut taxes on the middle class and simplify those brackets. And then we want to make the small business tax cuts permanent. They made corporate tax cuts permanent, but they made small business tax cuts temporary. Small businesses are the heartbeat of America. We need to prove it by making those tax cuts permanent. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, what\\'s your response? How would you make those essentials more affordable for Americans?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I disagree with Ambassador Haley. We don\\'t need an accountant in the White House, we need a leader in the White House. And that\\'s what I would bring. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve spoken with Iowans, visiting all 99 counties, and also folks all across this country. The American dream is slipping away. People are working hard. They\\'re getting the most out of their God- given ability. They\\'re doing everything right. And they\\'re falling further and further behind.</p>\\n<p>Trying to afford a new home today, your monthly mortgage payment would probably be twice as much as what it would have been if you were starting out five years ago. We have to make the economy work their those folks.</p>\\n<p>Yes, I\\'m going to battle the spending. In Florida, you look and we have the national debt clock going up to $34 trillion. I see it. If you did a debt clock for the state of Florida, it would be counting down.</p>\\n<p>Because we\\'ve paid down 25 percent of our state debt just since I\\'ve been governor. We\\'re going to open up all energy for production because that will be deflationary.</p>\\n<p>You know, Nikki Haley when she was governor, she promised she would never do the gas tax. Then she tried to raise the gas tax on hardworking South Carolinians. Here\\'s the thing. We need to fly a flag of bold colors carrying the banner of putting the American people first, not the pale pastel of the warmed over corporatism of people like Nikki Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, I want to bring you in, but because Governor DeSantis mentioned the gas tax, you do want to eliminate the federal gas tax. And that tax generated approximately $40 billion in 2022 and helps pay for road construction and repair.</p>\\n<p>So how would you fix America\\'s roads and bridges if you take that money away?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, bless his heart. Desantislies.com. We have never raised a tax.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You try to.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> We\\'ve never raised a tax at all.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You tried. You\\'re on video.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I can tell you right --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So I can tell you that we killed the gas tax multiple times.</p>\\n<p>But what we said is if you want to raise the gas tax, you have to reduce the income tax by five times that amount. They didn\\'t want to do it. We\\'ve killed taxes every step of the way.</p>\\n<p>But if he\\'s going to talk about his economy, I think what we should say is why does Florida have the highest property insurance in the country? Why is it that it is named the American hotspot for inflation? Why is it that his state is now known to have the highest cost of living increases? And why is it that they\\'re saying senior citizens can no longer afford to live in Florida? So that\\'s the first thing I\\'ll say. We don\\'t need him doing that to our country.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to the gas tax, when we eliminate that federal tax, the money is collected in the states and they send it to the feds. The feds attach a lot of strings to it and send it back. 75 percent comes from the state, 25 percent comes from the federal government.</p>\\n<p>What they do when they add those strings is they pay for a lot of things that aren\\'t roads, green spaces, sidewalks, all of those things, but they attach strings. I want that money to stay in the states. I want the states to be able to decide how to spend it. I don\\'t want Washington bureaucrats deciding what we need for scenery and green space and all those other things. I want every state, including the state of Iowa, to make the decisions on how they spend their road spending instead of the federal government.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She kind of admitted that she did try to raise the gas tax, and she\\'s on video saying this. I know she\\'ll say she never said. But she did.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You snippet that.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She did -- she did do it.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You took a little piece of that. That is not true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She also -- she also raise tax --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You are lying again.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She was in South Carolina, that\\'s on the record. And she even proposed a tax on groceries at one point. But I\\'m just thinking, have you seen your grocery bill lately? That\\'s one of the things that\\'s hitting working people the most, that groceries are going up probably twice as much what you do.</p>\\n<p>But I also think it\\'s important that we lift people up. So in Florida, we eliminated all sales tax on every baby item, diapers, wipes, strollers, cribs. We want families to be able to prosper in this country. One of the things that\\'s causing so much problem is the breakdown in the American family. We\\'ve done a lot in Florida to be able to rejuvenate that. But we need to make it easier for people to raise children in this country so that we can have strong families in a strong country.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, at a CNN town hall last week, you said you support a flat tax, which is a single income tax rate for every American. Under your plan, would working families pay the same tax rate as billionaires?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I would only do it if people are better off than they are now. I mean, I want people paying less taxes. Actually, if you think the last year we have numbers for the federal government took in the highest percentage of taxes from the economy since World War II, and yet they\\'re going deep into debt.</p>\\n<p>We have a spending problem in this country. It\\'s not a tax problem in this country. And if you had something that was simple and transparent, not only would that better for economic growth, it\\'s also better to end the weaponization of government.</p>\\n<p>The IRS has been weaponized against conservatives going back to the Obama administration. I was there for that. No one\\'s been held accountable for doing that.</p>\\n<p>You look at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, the weaponization of federal power ends the day I become the president of the United States. There\\'s going to be a new sheriff in town. We\\'re going to restore the constitutional accountability that our founding fathers envision when they formatted the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>And you know, I\\'ve talked to folks who have overbearing federal agencies. I mean, you have farmers who have the EPA coming on their farmland because there\\'s maybe a puddle there, waters of the United States. Give me a break.</p>\\n<p>So we\\'re going to reduce the size of government, but we\\'re also going to reduce the scope of government.</p>\\n<p>And in Florida, I\\'ve actually delivered on this, Florida has the lowest percentage of state government workers per capita in the country, and the cost of our state government employees is the lowest in the country.</p>\\n<p>No wonder why we\\'re paying down debt while we\\'re cutting taxes for people. That\\'s the way to do it. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, 15-second point of clarification. The question was whether or not working families would pay the same amount...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They would pay...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> ... as billionaires?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They would pay less than what they\\'re paying now. The way I view it is, OK -- and you\\'d exempt people -- so you would pay no tax for -- for working-class people. It would only be as you get above. Because I think the first $40,000, $50,000 grand, that\\'s just to subsist. And even some places, you can\\'t even do that.</p>\\n<p>So you would have no tax up to a certain point, and then it would just be a single rate. So if somebody...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... makes $100,000, they pay a certain amount. If someone makes $200,000, they pay...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They make twice as much, and they pay twice as much.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, first of all, you just can\\'t trust what he says. I mean, that\\'s the biggest thing. We don\\'t have a grocery tax in South Carolina. And I never once raised taxes, period.</p>\\n<p>But what I will tell you is, it is to call into question, why did he promise he\\'d never raise the debt limit and he turned around and he raised it?</p>\\n<p>And then you want to go, and you see one side of what he says early on, and then he changes it. So here he goes and he says that he is all for energy independence. He wants to get the EPA out of the way. Well, why did he run on the fact that he wanted to ban fracking and ban offshore drilling?</p>\\n<p>Why did he go and author that legislation to eliminate the renewable fuel standard that so -- that matters so much?</p>\\n<p>And why now is he suddenly coming to Iowa and saying, \"Oh, never mind, I don\\'t mean all of that?\"</p>\\n<p>Why did he call Trump and say that he wanted him to stop drilling nine miles into federal waters? Why is he now saying this?</p>\\n<p>Why do you come to the people of Iowa and say one thing when you campaigned and, on day two of your office, you banned fracking; you banned offshore drilling,; you turned around and authored and led the charge on banning the renewable fuel standards...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yeah...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You\\'ve got to stand up for those things that you did.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You\\'ve been -- you\\'ve been beating that dead horse -- that\\'s been the...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Because it\\'s true, Ron. It\\'s true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We\\'re looking forward to be able to open up energy production, and definitely here in the Midwest, with biofuels. I\\'m the only one that checked all the boxes from the Iowa renewable fuel standard, because I\\'ve actually visited all 99 counties. I\\'ve actually shown up to people\\'s farms. I\\'ve sat and I\\'ve listened to people about what they\\'re going through, how their economy is structured and how it\\'s important that we\\'re producing energy here in the United States.</p>\\n<p>I never want to go hat in hand, like Biden has done, to Venezuela or Saudi and begging for energy. We\\'re going to be able to open up production. We\\'re going to choose Midland over Moscow. We\\'re going to choose the Marcellus Shale over the mullahs. And we\\'re going to choose the Bakken over Beijing.</p>\\n<p>Energy independence isn\\'t even -- it\\'s not -- it\\'s good for consumers. It\\'s good to reduce inflation. And it\\'s one of the best things we can do for our national security. So we\\'ll do that on day one, and we are going to reverse Biden\\'s green new deal and the electric vehicle mandates. We\\'ll save the American automobile.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>This has been one of the biggest years for illegal border crossings into the United States. Last month alone, 225,000 migrants illegally crossed the southern border. It\\'s a record high, overwhelming the Border Patrol resources that are already stretched thin. Mayors across the country say their cities are being pushed to a breaking point.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, former President Trump famously promised to build a wall on the southern border. He obviously did not get that done. You have promised to finish the job. How will you succeed where he failed?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We will build a wall. We will actually have Mexico pay for it, in the way that I thought Donald Trump was. We\\'re going to charge fees on remittances that workers send to foreign countries, billions of dollars. We\\'ll build the wall.</p>\\n<p>He also promised record deportations. Donald Trump deported fewer people than Barack Obama did when he was president. Biden\\'s let in 8 million people just in four years. They all have to go back. We have to enforce the rule of law in this country.</p>\\n<p>Think about what\\'s happening to our country. Just this week, we saw the news that a high -- that a school in Brooklyn, New York, had the kids stay home. They were not able to go to school, told you can\\'t go get an in-person education. Why? Because their -- the city\\'s commandeering the school to house illegal aliens in it.</p>\\n<p>Talk about putting Americans last. You\\'re putting these kids out of an education because you can\\'t control the border?</p>\\n<p>Biden has failed in this endeavor. He has not taken care that the laws of this country be faithfully executed.</p>\\n<p>Do not trust Nikki Haley with illegal immigration. That\\'s like having the fox guard the hen house. She\\'s on tape at the Aspen Institute -- she\\'ll say she didn\\'t say it -- she was chastising conservatives, saying it\\'s disrespectful to illegal aliens to say that they\\'re criminals.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re violating the law. It\\'s disrespectful when people come to this country illegally and impose burdens on our communities and run drugs into this country. That\\'s what\\'s disrespectful.</p>\\n<p>She\\'s weak on immigration. She\\'s bankrolled by people who want open borders. And she said there shouldn\\'t be a limit on immigration; you should work with corporate CEOS...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thanks, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That is pale pastels. That is warmed-over...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you so much.</p>\\n<p>So, Governor Haley...[<i>cheering and applause</i>]... Governor DeSantis and also Donald Trump are attacking you for that comment in 2015 in which you said undocumented immigrants should not be called -- quote -- \"criminals.\"</p>\\n<p>At the time, the full context is you said -- quote -- \"We don\\'t need to talk about them as criminals. They\\'re not. They\\'re families that want a better life, and they\\'re desperate to get here\" -- unquote.</p>\\n<p>Do you still feel that way?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I saw them. When I was at the United Nations, I saw them. That doesn\\'t mean we should let them into our country.</p>\\n<p>I mean, first of all, I will tell you that, when I was governor of South Carolina, we passed the toughest illegal immigration law in the country. Obama sued us over it, and we won. We fought Obama on illegal immigration. We fought Obama on migrant kids. We fought Obama on Syrian refugees. We fought Obama on Guantanamo Bay prisoners.</p>\\n<p>I have always said we are a country of laws. The second we stop being a country of laws, we give up everything this country was founded on.</p>\\n<p>But I will tell you, in passing that toughest illegal immigration law in the country, we passed E-Verify, which I want to take national, which is where businesses have to prove that the people they hire are in this country legally. I passed it within six months of being governor. Ron didn\\'t pass it for five years.</p>\\n<p>He only waited to pass it when he decided to run for president. What we need to do is not just ban a wall. We need to put 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents on the ground and let them do their job. We need to defund sanctuary cities once and for all, no more safe havens for illegal immigrants.</p>\\n<p>We need to make sure we go back to the remain-in-Mexico policy, so that no one even steps foot on U.S. soil. And instead of catch-and- release, we need to go to catch-and-deport. That\\'s the only way we will stop the incentives of these illegal immigrants coming across.</p>\\n<p>Biden turned around and gave half-a-million Venezuelans temporary protective status. That\\'s half-a-million driver\\'s licenses, half-a- million Social Security numbers. All that does is incentivize them to pick up the phone...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... call their family members, and tell them to come on ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She did bring...[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>When she was governor, she did bring Syrian refugees, and she got criticized for that.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> That is not true.

In fact, you have got them from China, Iran, Russia, the Middle East. When I was down there a couple years ago, because I have sent people down there, you had people from Libya and Haiti.</p>\\n<p>This is a ticking time bomb for this country. There are, of course, going to be terrorist cells that have come in. It\\'s like the lowest- cost way to be able to harm this country. Just send people across the southern border.</p>\\n<p>Nikki Haley also opposed the border wall in 2016. She said that -- she ridiculed it when Donald Trump was for that. I\\'m telling you, you need a wall. You can\\'t trust politicians to do this. If the wall\\'s there, it\\'s a physical fact of life. And it\\'s a huge step to restoring this country\\'s sovereignty.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis. Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Go to DeSantislies.com. I said, you can\\'t just build a wall. You have to do more than build a wall. It was having the wall and everything else. You can\\'t trust what Ron is saying.</p>\\n<p>But this is a bigger issue. This is more than him just constantly being desperate and throwing things on me. This is the fact that we have to realize my parents came here legally. They came the right way 50 years ago. They put in the time. They put in the price. They are offended by what\\'s happening on the border.</p>\\n<p>And my mom would always say, if they don\\'t follow the laws to come into this country, they won\\'t follow the laws when they are in this country. And we have to start treating this like it is. This is putting harm on our schools, on our hospitals. Taxpayers are paying for it. You see these mayors are now upset about it.</p>\\n<p>The only reason Eric Adams is now upset, why? He shouldn\\'t be a sanctuary city then. That\\'s why we have to defund sanctuary cities. Now Governor Abbott finally did to them what\\'s been happening to Texas for so long. We have got to put an end to this. It\\'s dangerous, and it doesn\\'t even count the fentanyl that\\'s happening.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you. Thank you, Governor. Thank you. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, there are more than 10 million undocumented immigrants already living in the United States, according to Pew Research.</p>\\n<p>Will any of them be allowed to stay in the United States under your administration?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The number of people that will be amnestied when I\\'m president is zero.</p>\\n<p>We cannot do an amnesty in this country. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>First of all, all it\\'s going to do is cause more people to want to come illegally. So you have got to enforce the law. It\\'s got to be consistent. People got to know it\\'s there.</p>\\n<p>You also have to remove benefits for people who are here illegally. California, you can go, illegal alien, and you get free health insurance coverage. You\\'re here illegally, and they\\'re doing that? We should not let states provide these benefits.</p>\\n<p>In Florida, obviously, we don\\'t do that. We don\\'t allow the driver\\'s license and all that. But some states do. And it creates a magnet for people coming in. So, federally, no benefits, no enticements to come in, and then the states, we\\'re going to crack down on sanctuary states and sanctuary cities.</p>\\n<p>And I showed the hypocrisy of all this back in 2022 because we have a program to transport illegal aliens to sanctuary jurisdictions. And one of the places we sent 52, beautiful, liberal Martha\\'s Vineyard.</p>\\n<p>And you know what? These are folks that were on their high horse, saying how they were sanctuary jurisdiction, saying nobody is illegal. All refugees are welcome. That\\'s what they had in their town. The minute even 50 came up, they called the state of emergency and deported them off the island the next day. How do you think Texas feels? How do you think all these other communities feel that are overwhelming -- being overwhelmed?</p>\\n<p>So, we cannot have liberal elites in this country imposing policies on the rest of us that they are not willing to deal with the consequences of them.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, by the -- when you\\'re President, will any of the more than 10 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. be allowed to stay in the country under your administration?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You have to deport them. And the reason you have to deport them is they\\'re cutting the line. You\\'ve got people who have done this and tried to go through the right way. You can\\'t have them go and jump the line, and suddenly do that. And that is actually what will get them to stop coming, is when they do realize they get to the wall and they have to turn around and go back. It\\'s a dangerous process of what happens for them to try and migrate here.</p>\\n<p>But, when I was at the United Nations, and we had this, which is another reason why we need to have Trump here defending himself and talking about what he would do going in the future, because it\\'s a problem. I was on the ground in Honduras and Guatemala. And what we saw as a lot of the reason why they were coming from there is because of gangs and drugs. And so, what we did was we had our military go and train them on how to deal with gangs. We went and put drug boats on the water to keep the drugs from coming. But, we said you have to have them processed from here. You can\\'t have them come. We were able to stop that flow. We\\'ve got to go back to do that. But, we need to end it once and for all. Donald Trump didn\\'t do that. That\\'s why he needs to be here debating on the stage right now.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor, thank you. Let\\'s turn to foreign policy. You have expressed different visions for how the U.S. should approach the international complex. And I want to start with Ukraine. It\\'s been nearly two years since Russia invaded Ukraine, and there is still no end in sight to that war. Governor Haley, you say that this is a \"war about freedom that Ukraine must win.\" Governor DeSantis says, \"We need to bring this war to an end.\" Do you believe he shares your commitment to a Ukrainian victory?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Nobody knows what he believes, because when President Obama was in office, he supported foreign aid to Ukraine. Now, he is copying Trump and trying to act like he doesn\\'t want to support Ukraine. But, let me tell you why Ukraine should matter. First of all, I don\\'t think we should give cash to any country, friend or foe, because you can\\'t follow it. You can\\'t hold it accountable. I don\\'t think we need to put troops on the ground. And Ukrainians want to win this themselves.</p>\\n<p>But, dictators always say, always do what they say they\\'re going to do. China said they were going to take Hong Kong. They did. Russia said they were going to invade Ukraine. They -- we watched it. China says Taiwan is next. We better believe them. Russia said once they take Ukraine, Poland and the Baltics are next. Those are NATO countries, and that puts America at war. This is about preventing war. It\\'s always been about preventing war.</p>\\n<p>If we support Ukraine, that\\'s only 3.5 percent of our defense budget. Biden and no one else is telling the American people the truth about that. The Europeans have put in more than that, and they should. It\\'s their neighborhood. But, this is a pro-American freedom-loving country. And we better remember that you have to be a friend to get a friend. And we needed a lot of friends, September 12. We\\'ve got to make sure that we\\'re having the backs of the right friends, because if Russia wins, China wins. There is a reason the Taiwanese want us to help the Ukrainians. And that\\'s because they know if Ukraine wins, China won\\'t invade Taiwan. This is about preventing war.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I supported Trump\\'s policy vis-a-vis Russia, Ukraine, and it was successful. You know, the Biden policy has not been. But, Nikki Haley is basically a carbon copy of what Biden is. It\\'s an open-ended commitment. They want another $108 billion. They will not tell you when the -- they have achieved their goal. And this is going to go on maybe hundreds of billions more into the future. I think a lot of people have died. We need to find a way to end this, because our priorities for national security, of course, the border, which we talked about, and people like Nikki Haley care more about Ukraine\\'s border than she does about our own southern border, which is wrong.</p>\\n<p>But, we also have to look at what\\'s the top threat to this country. It\\'s the Chinese Communist Party. We are not doing what we need to do to have adequate hard power in the Indo-Pacific. And here is the thing. We don\\'t have enough resources, being $35 trillion in debt, to continue doing hundreds of billions of dollars. We got to focus on our issues here at home.</p>\\n<p>And we\\'ve got to deal with the top threat that we face, which is China.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> And then I wonder why you raised the debt when you were in Congress, because we\\'re all paying for that.</p>\\n<p>What I will tell you is, this is the lie they\\'re telling the American people over and over again. It is so wrong to say this. They\\'re saying you have to choose between Ukraine or Israel, or Israel and -- and securing the border. Supporting Ukraine is 3.5 percent of our budget. I don\\'t want cash going. It\\'s equipment and it\\'s ammunition. If we support Ukraine and Israel, that\\'s only 5 percent of our defense budget. If we support...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So you\\'re going to borrow that?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> If we support Ukraine, Israel, and secure the border, that\\'s less than 20 percent of Biden\\'s green subsidies. You do not have to choose when it comes to national security. This is about keeping Americans safe. This is about preventing war. This is about keeping our military men and women from having to fight a war. And you only do that when you focus on national security, not telling lies to the American people that they have to choose. That is wrong. That\\'s never been the case. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Here is the problem with what she\\'s saying. She -- she doesn\\'t articulate how this comes to an end, except she was asked after the last debate by, I believe, Megyn Kelly, and she said, you bring to it an end by bringing Ukraine into NATO. But, of course, we\\'re a NATO country. So if you bring Ukraine into NATO, that puts the United States at war. Megyn said that to her, and then she basically gave a word salad as to how you go from there.</p>\\n<p>So they have sent cash. She supports this $106 billion that they\\'re trying to get through Congress. Where is some of that money going? They\\'ve done tens of billions of dollars to pay salaries for Ukrainian government bureaucrats. They\\'ve paid pensions for Ukrainian retirees with your tax dollars?</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve got homeless veterans. We have all these problems. This is the U.N. way of thinking that we\\'re somehow globalists and we have unlimited resources to do. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>You know, I think here\\'s the problem. You can take the ambassador out of the United Nations, but you can\\'t take the United Nations out of the ambassador. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, I have never said that we should give salaries or benefits or anything else to Ukrainians. I have said it again, Ron, so stop lying. DeSantislies.com.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But you supported the aid packages.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, she has the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So you go -- I did not support the aid package. I support equipment and ammunition going to Ukraine. I think it is incredibly important that we\\'re honest and say we have to focus on national security. Don\\'t go and lie to the American people to make them think we can\\'t do this.</p>\\n<p>You turned around and raised the debt limit. You\\'re the one that\\'s talked about, look at what you did to Florida. But think about the fact that he is talking about where is this money going to come from. You -- the best way to tell about a candidate is to see how they\\'ve run their campaign.</p>\\n<p>He has blown through $150 million. I don\\'t know how you do that. Through his campaign, he has nothing to show for it. He spent more money on private planes than he has on commercials trying to get Iowans to vote for him. If you can\\'t manage a campaign, how are you going to manage a country? Which is exactly...[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, listen, I\\'m proud of -- I\\'m proud that in the state of Florida, we\\'re ranked number one for economy of all 50 states by CNBC. Number one...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest cost of living.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... in education. She was ranked number 50 in education...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest...</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... when she was governor of California (ph)...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Highest insurance in the country.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, he...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> ... wasn\\'t able to do school choice. She didn\\'t deliver big tax cuts. We\\'re also number one for net end migration, number one for GDP growth amongst large states, number one for talent development, number one for new business formations, and on and on it goes.</p>\\n<p>So the success we\\'ve had in Florida, I can cite the statistics. It\\'s important. But just look at how people are voting with their feet. They\\'re leaving California. They\\'re leaving Illinois, New York, all these states, and they\\'re coming to Florida in record numbers because we\\'re doing it right.</p>\\n<p>And not only have I cut taxes big time, where she didn\\'t as governor of South Carolina, we\\'ve paid down 25 percent of our state\\'s debt. That\\'s how you manage the third-largest state in this country. Just imagine if we could do that for the United States of America. [<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So thank you. Let\\'s stay on foreign policy. I want to turn to the Israel-Hamas war. You both have said that you unequivocally support Israel. You both have called for the complete elimination of Hamas.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, there are real disagreements within Israel about how to handle what happens in Gaza after the war against Hamas is over. Some Israeli cabinet officials are pushing for the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza. Governor Haley told CNN last week she does not support that. Do you?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So we\\'ve got to support Israel in word and in deed, in public and in private. And they need to be able to finish the job. Joe Biden is kneecapping them. He\\'ll say one thing, then he goes and his base doesn\\'t like Israel, so he has got to do all these other things. This is a time to recognize that they\\'ve suffered the most deaths of Jews, murder of Jews since the Holocaust. Hamas wants a second Holocaust. They want to annihilate the state of Israel. So I think to be a good ally, you back them in the decisions that they\\'re making with respect to Gaza.</p>\\n<p>Look, there\\'s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you\\'re doing this. But for us to be sitting in Washington second guessing them, I don\\'t think that\\'s the right way.</p>\\n<p>We also have a disagreement. Governor Haley and I, when she was at the U.N., she supported the idea of a two-state solution between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs. The problem with that is the Palestinian Arabs don\\'t recognize Israel\\'s right to exist as a Jewish state. So doing a two-state solution doesn\\'t create something that\\'s going to lead to a lasting peace. It creates a stepping stone for Israel\\'s destruction.</p>\\n<p>So under no circumstances as president am I going to pressure Israel to risk their security to do a so called two-state solution. She was wrong when she embraced that. And we\\'re right to say we trust Israel to make these decisions. They\\'re a good ally of ours. We should trust their judgment on these sensitive issues.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, 15 seconds, 15 seconds clarification. Do you support the mass removal of Palestinians from Gaza?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So as president, I am not going to tell them to do that. I think there\\'s a lot of issues with that. But if they make the calculation that to avert a second holocaust, they need to do that. I think some of these Palestinian Arabs, Saudi Arabia should take some.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Egypt should take some. They\\'ve never been willing to accept any of these facts in their own neighborhood.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor. Thank you, governor. Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, we need to understand the reason we need to support Israel is Israel\\'s a bright spot in a tough neighborhood. They are the tip of the spear when it comes to defeating terrorism. It has never been that Israel needs America. It has always been that America needs Israel.</p>\\n<p>When I was at the United Nations, I fought every day for Israel. And if you would have listened to what I said at the United Nations, a two-state solution wasn\\'t something that was possible because Israel would always come to the table and the Palestinians wouldn\\'t.</p>\\n<p>But right now, we have to make sure that Israel has the support that it needs. There should be three things. Give Israel whatever it wants to get the job done. Two, eliminate Hamas once and for all. And three, do whatever it takes to bring the hostages home.</p>\\n<p>But it\\'s really rich that Ron is going to act like he suddenly cares for Israel when he brought the person to Iowa that\\'s the most anti- Israel Republican in the state, the person that went and voted against Israel\\'s right to exist in Congress, the person that voted with the squad against antisemitism on college campuses.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> And you brought that person --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- to Iowa to go and campaign with. That\\'s your friend.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor DeSantis, she\\'s obviously referring to Congressman Tom Massey from Kentucky.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yes. I mean, that\\'s just cheap garbage. But here\\'s the thing. When the attack --</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s true.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> -- happened against Israel, I knew it was going to be a big deal for Florida. We have one of the largest Israeli American populations in the country, and we\\'ve been a haven for orthodox Jews in particular since I\\'ve been governor. And you know what? Biden wasn\\'t helping Americans get out of the war zone. These are people that were stranded. So I did an executive order. We scrambled planes and we rescued over 700 Americans from Israel and brought them back safely to the state of Florida. You got to step up and you got to lead when things like this are happening.</p>\\n<p>We also have gone after the antisemitism on our campuses. We did that early in my administration. You didn\\'t see our college presidents doing some of the things that you\\'ve seen.</p>\\n<p>I just announced in the state of the state address yesterday or two days ago that we are going to say not just for Jewish students, anyone who\\'s having religious, being persecuted or being marginalized because of their faith in any college around the country, we\\'re going to waive the transfer requirements so that people can come to Florida and be safe.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> What they are doing to Jewish students has been reprehensible.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> We\\'re not going to let it out.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So there are -- I\\'m coming to you. There are growing fears of this war escalating into a broader regional conflict. And, Governor Haley, just yesterday the U.S. Navy shot down 21 missiles and drones fired by Iranian backed militants in the Red Sea. Iranian backed militants are now also attacking U.S. and western interests in Syria and Iraq. Your fellow South Carolinian Republican senator Lindsey Graham is calling for the U.S. to conduct retaliatory strikes inside Iran. Would you order strikes inside Iran?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, first of all, notice Ron didn\\'t say anything about the fact that he did bring that most anti-Israel Republican into this state to campaign. He also hasn\\'t told you that the only Republican Jewish state legislator left his campaign because he wasn\\'t dealing with the neo-Nazi marches and wasn\\'t dealing with antisemitism properly.</p>\\n<p>When it comes to Iran, what we have to understand, there would be no Hamas without Iran. There would not be Houthis without Iran. There wouldn\\'t be Hezbollah without Iran. And when you look at the strikes that are happening in Iraq and Syria, that is because of Ron. They\\'re pulling the puppet strings.</p>\\n<p>What we need to do is the idea that we\\'ve had over 130 strikes on our men and women in Iraq and Syria is unconscionable. We\\'re supposed to have their backs. And Biden has been slow. He\\'s been hiding in a corner and he hasn\\'t dealt with it.</p>\\n<p>We need to go and take out every bit of the production that they have that\\'s allowing them to do those strikes. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. And you can\\'t do that if you have a secretary of defense that is in ICU and the president doesn\\'t even know about it.</p>\\n<p>Look, there\\'s a lot of pluses and minuses with how you\\'re doing this.

They fund Hamas. They fund Hezbollah. We did a special session of the legislature down in Florida. We expanded sanctions against Iran. If we were our own country, we\\'d be the 14th largest economy in the world.</p>\\n<p>The root of this is Biden came into office and he relaxed the sanctions on Iran.

And that is, what is the role of government, and should it use its power to go after businesses and private entities that take actions that don\\'t align with conservative values?</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, you used your powers in Florida to take on Disney after the company criticized an education bill that you signed into law. How does that square with the traditional conservative view that small, limited government is best?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The proper role of government, if it means every -- anything, it\\'s to protect our kids.</p>\\n<p>And I have stood for the innocence of our kids. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>It is wrong -- it is wrong to sexualize the curriculum. It\\'s wrong -- my wife and I, we have got a first grader, a kindergarten and a preschooler.</p>\\n<p>This is something that\\'s important to us personally. It\\'s wrong to tell a kindergartner, like Disney wanted to do, that you can change your gender or tell a third grader that you\\'re born in the wrong body. So I stood up against -- yes, the media didn\\'t like it, the left didn\\'t like it, and Disney didn\\'t like it.</p>\\n<p>And they\\'re the 800-pound gorilla in the state of Florida. Most people, most corporate Republicans would have caved. I stood and I fought for the kids. We took on Disney, and we defeated that and we won that fight and our kids are better off.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley sided with Disney. She invited them to South Carolina, even though they were involved in transing kids. That is not what we need to do. But I think that\\'s similar. She is representative of this corporatist element of the party. For example, she supported $900 million in subsidies to Boeing when she was in South Carolina. And then, when she got out of office, she took a seat on their board, and she made millions of dollars. Then she gave speeches, paid speeches, to a lot of Wall Street interests, didn\\'t publish what she said. We don\\'t know what she promised them.</p>\\n<p>And she made millions of dollars doing that. Now they\\'re the ones that are funding her campaign. So we need to stand up for the people, and not bow down to woke corporations. And we know Nikki Haley will cave to the woke mob every single time. [<i>cheering and applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, a response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Government was intended to secure the rights and freedoms of the people. It was never meant to be all things to all people.</p>\\n<p>And what we don\\'t need is government politicizing anything. The first thing I will say is, again, DeSantislies.com, because I have never said anything related to the transgender stuff he says. I have always fought to protect kids. I have always said that boys need to go into boys\\' bathrooms, girls need to go into girls\\' bathrooms, that we shouldn\\'t have any gender transitions before the age of 18.</p>\\n<p>Just like we don\\'t have tattoos before the age of 18, we shouldn\\'t have gender transformation or puberty blockers. But I will tell you that it\\'s really interesting that Ron talks about this -- Disney, because Disney has been woke for a long time.</p>\\n<p>They were against the immigration situation that Trump was doing. They were against the Paris climate agreement when I did it. They were against the pro-life bill in Georgia. Ron didn\\'t have any problem with that. As a matter of fact, he gave them the largest corporate subsidies in Florida history.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That\\'s false.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> He had tech exemptions that he gave -- didn\\'t give any tech exemptions to anybody but Disney.</p>\\n<p>Yet, when they went and criticized him, he got thin-skinned and suddenly started to fight back. We don\\'t need government fighting against our private industries. We are not woke in South Carolina. I will always invite businesses to come to South Carolina.</p>\\n<p>But the one thing you don\\'t do is, government doesn\\'t bully our businesses. And that can\\'t happen. And Ron has determined anybody that offends him...</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So...</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... he goes after them, and he will use government...</p>\\n<p>[<i>crosstalk</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She just said she\\'s always fought to protect kids.

I\\'m glad she\\'s come to the right thing.</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the deal, it goes back to that young kid in the town hall that she had where he said, Nikki Haley, you are the new John Kerry, you are for it before you were against it.

And if there are any other exceptions, they use a private bathroom.</p>\\n<p>I have fought for women\\'s sports and making sure that biological boys are not in women\\'s sports.

Given that, why should voters concerned about K through 12 education support you rather than other Republicans?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Because I think what we did was we knew that there was an issue. We knew in South Carolina if a child couldn\\'t read by third grade they were four times less likely to graduate high school. So what we did is, we started holding kids back instead of pushing them forward. We brought in their parents. We did reading remediation. And we set them up for success.</p>\\n<p>We\\'ve got to do that all over the country. We only had 31 percent of eighth graders in the country are proficient in reading, 27 percent of eighth graders are proficient in math. If we don\\'t do something, we\\'re going to be in a world of hurt 10 years from now.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s why I want to take as many federal programs from D.C. as we can and send them down to the state level. Think education. We can move a lot of K through 12 programs down to the state level, reduce the strings that are attached, and that way states can handle it themselves. People in Iowa know best what types of education they need.</p>\\n<p>Secondly, parents should decide what types of education their children get, what mode of education. And we should have complete transparency in the classroom. No parent should ever wonder what\\'s being said or taught to their child in the classroom. That\\'s why we\\'ll have all of the curriculums online for every parent to see.</p>\\n<p>And we need to start putting vocational classes back in our high schools. Let\\'s teach our kids how to do things. We did that in South Carolina. We had apprenticeships. We taught our kids how to build the things we are making.</p>\\n<p>When we start putting education back in the states and away from D.C., that\\'s when we\\'ll start to see that we are going back to the basics. We\\'re doing what parents want. And we\\'re doing what the industries...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> ... in that state need.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well...</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>[<i>applause</i>]</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, I\\'m coming to you right now. Governor DeSantis, you have supported limits on what subjects can be taught and how, including American history in Florida schools. You have also made it easier to remove books from public school libraries. You say you want to, quote, \"make America Florida.\" Do you want to implement those Florida school policies nationwide?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I\\'ll get to that in a sec. So Nikki Haley said she wants parents to decide on the education. She campaigned for governor saying she was going to do school choice, to be able to give private scholarships, particularly to low-income families. And she was governor and never did it. She caved to the teachers union.</p>\\n<p>I delivered the biggest school choice expansion in the history of the United States. We beat the teachers union. We\\'ve even done paycheck protection so that school unions -- so that teachers aren\\'t force to do dues, and now they\\'re choosing other things. So we\\'ve done it right in Florida. And the results speak for themselves.</p>\\n<p>We have one of the top performing fourth grade reading and math in the country. And if you just took our charter school population, 365,000 kids, disproportionately low income, racial, ethnic minorities, if they were their own state, they\\'d be in the top five in performance. Everyone can succeed, but you\\'ve got to have a leader who\\'s going to fight the teachers unions and is going to deliver school choice.</p>\\n<p>Governor Kim Reynolds did that here in Iowa, who\\'s endorsed me. Nikki Haley did not. She failed. And if she can\\'t do it in the reddest state in the country of South Carolina, how are you going to be able to succeed in Washington, D.C.?</p>\\n<p>Now, in terms of what we\\'ve done, we believe in empowering parents, and there are certain standards about what\\'s age and developmentally appropriate. It\\'s wrong to have pornographic materials in fourth or fifth grade. And you know what\\'s happened? They\\'ll go to school board meetings all around the country. They\\'ll start reading it and they, oh, no, no, it\\'s too graphic. You can\\'t read it here. You can\\'t put it on the 6:00 news.</p>\\n<p>Well, if it\\'s not appropriate in a school board meeting and you can\\'t put on the 6:00 news, why are you jamming it down the throats of a fourth grader?</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor, just a point of clarification, do you want to implement Florida\\'s education policies nationwide?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> It depends on the policy. School choice universal, yes. I don\\'t want a nationalized curriculum. I think that that\\'s a bottom up thing. I want to get rid of the federal Department of Education, get that weight off the backs of the state and local governments. But we are going to do nationwide scholarships through the tax credits, and that\\'s going to bail out a lot of poor kids throughout this country.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I have fought for school choice in my entire career because I think parents know their children best, and I think we should always do that. That\\'s why we passed charter school legislation in our state. That\\'s why we empowered homeschoolers in our state. That\\'s why we changed the funding formula. So, we lifted up challenged areas without bringing down the wealthy areas.</p>\\n<p>We wanted school choice. I had a Republican legislature that wouldn\\'t do it, but we pushed hard to get that done. That doesn\\'t mean that we shouldn\\'t do it across the country. But what we have to do is we have to make it state centric. We\\'ve got to get these programs down to the state level. We\\'ve got to let the focus be on teachers. Teachers right now have to be the guidance counselors, the pastors, the nurses and everything in between. And, oh, by the way, they have to teach to a test. That\\'s not what teachers want. Teachers want to do what they were taught to do. And that means math, science, reading, history, English, arts. That\\'s it.</p>\\n<p>Schools can\\'t be all things to all kids. They need to let the parents parent. They need to let teachers teach. And we need to go back to the basics in education so we get our kids --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. I want to move on.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That is the problem, though. That word salad is the problem.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> She said she\\'s always supported school choice and she failed to deliver. She blames other people. Leadership is about getting things done. Stop making excuses. Make it happen.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> If leadership is about getting things done, how did you blow through $150 million in your campaign, and you were down in the polls. You are not a man of word. No, I\\'m going to say --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think it\\'s very instructive about what Nikki Haley sees the world.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think I have the floor.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, Governor Haley --</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> What is more important here? She\\'s saying somehow that that\\'s not --</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, it\\'s Governor Haley\\'s time. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think I hit a nerve. What I will tell you is, look, if you can\\'t manage a campaign -- it\\'s been a revolving door of political people in and out of his campaign. You\\'ve heard of campaign people going to blows with each other because they can\\'t all agree. $150 million, and he spent more on private planes than commercials. I flew commercial. I stayed in residence inns. We went and saved our money. We made sure we spent it right because you have to understand, it\\'s not your money, it\\'s other people\\'s money, and you have to know how to handle it. If he can\\'t handle the financial parts of a campaign, how is he going to handle the economy when it comes to the White House?</p>\\n<p>And he goes, and he has been demeaning me over and over again, telling lies, desantislies.com, because he thinks it makes him look bigger. But in the one basic thing, you\\'ve campaigned for president in one state, you\\'re invisible in New Hampshire, you\\'re invisible. In South Carolina, you\\'re in fifth place, you\\'ve got $150 million and you\\'ve gone down in the polls in Iowa. Why should we think you can manage or do anything in this country?</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> This is a great window into leadership because she focused on a lot of political process stuff, things that no voter cares about, and she couldn\\'t tell you why she failed to deliver school choice to people in her state after she promised it. So, she says somehow that is the indicative of me.</p>\\n<p>No, leadership is about producing results. We\\'ve produced the results in Florida. We did universal school choice. We\\'ve cut taxes, we banned sanctuary cities on and on down the line, everything I promised, I delivered. She doesn\\'t have a rationale for why she couldn\\'t get it done. That is poor leadership. You look at me. Everything I promised I would do, I\\'ve delivered. And you can expect nothing less when I\\'m the president of the United States.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re going to move on now.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I need to respond to that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, you want to talk about leadership, and he wants to go and demean and put down. Let me tell you what leadership is. Leadership is the fact that I went into South Carolina that had 11 percent unemployment rate. Leadership is the fact that we turned it into an economic powerhouse, building planes, building cars, building tires.</p>\\n<p>We were named the beasts of the southeast. We moved the 11 percent unemployment down to 4 percent. We announced jobs in every county in the state. We moved 35,000 people on welfare to work. We changed our prison system to where we now have the lowest recidivism rate in the country. We passed voter I.D. We passed tort reform. We did pension form. We paid down our debt. We cut taxes. We made sure that people were proud again. We did eVerify in the first six months, not five years, like Ron.</p>\\n<p>So, don\\'t go and pick on school choice and say that that\\'s leadership. When I got to the U.N., we cut a billion dollars off the top, and we took the kick me sign off of our backs, and America was respected again at the U.N. I know what leadership is.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re moving on to a topic, governors, that both of you have made central to your campaigns, and that is China. Governor Haley, American farmers were hurt by former President Trump\\'s trade war with China. As a result, his administration paid out $28 billion in subsidies to farmers. You have vowed to be even tougher than Donald Trump on China. If your trade policies also end up hurting America\\'s farmers, are you prepared to cut a check just like he did?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, that\\'s why Trump should be here on this debate stage. He should have to defend it. So, first of all, I\\'ve said China is our number one national security threat. I fought them every single day at the United Nations. I know what they\\'re capable of. The first thing we have to do is we have to make sure we stop selling them any land and we take back the land they already purchased. We need to go to our universities and we say, you either take Chinese money or you take American money but the days of taking both are over. We need to stop all of the technologies that are going to China. Biden approved 70 percent of them. Trump approved even more than that. We have to tell them we\\'re going to end all normal trade relations with them until they stop murdering Americans with fentanyl. And we need to make sure we build up our military.</p>\\n<p>But the biggest thing, I was very attached to China in terms of trade, and the one thing we\\'ll do is we won\\'t wait for the China to pull the rug out from under Iowans. What we\\'ll do is instead, we will move that trade to where we have friends. We will go and build partnerships, India, Japan, South Korea, Philippines, Australia, Israel. We will go and move that trade over.</p>\\n<p>Right now, you can ask our farmers when they go and they buy from China, China orders, cancels the order, then goes and tries to buy it cheap. That\\'s what China does. Our farmers deserve better than that. We will get them trade deals.</p>\\n<p>When I was governor in South Carolina, we sold and we exported everything we were making in South Carolina. When I\\'m president, we will sell and export everything that\\'s being made in Iowa to those that are our friends, not our enemies.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor DeSantis, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> The way you deal with China is threefold. One, we need more hard power in the Indo-Pacific. I\\'m a Navy guy. We need more sea power. We\\'re going to build that up and we\\'re going to have a strategy to deny their ability to invade Taiwan or to get beyond the first island chain. On the current course, they\\'re going to take advantage of Biden and we\\'re going to rue the day when that happens.</p>\\n<p>Second, we got to decouple our economy, particularly things that are significant to our national survival. And you\\'ve got to be methodical, strategic about it. There\\'s a lot of moving parts there. But we\\'re going to do.</p>\\n<p>Nikki Haley\\'s not going to be able to do that because a lot of her supporters make a lot of money in China. And so she\\'s going to talk tough, but she\\'ll cave on that.</p>\\n<p>And then also with here in the United States, she\\'s saying they shouldn\\'t be buying land and be in the universities. When she was governor of South Carolina, the state gave China land and they were in the universities. As governor in Florida, I banned China from buying land and we kicked them out of our universities. That\\'s what you want to do.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> DeSantislies.com, he has an economic development arm. You had an office in Hong Kong. On the website, it said that Florida is a great place for Chinese companies to do business. And then when we called you out on it, you had the website scrubbed. So, we know that that\\'s the case. What I will tell you is we need to focus on what we\\'re going to do to become less dependent on China, and we need to make sure that we look at it through a national security lens.</p>\\n<p>When we had COVID, everybody told you to wear a mask. It was made in China. They told you to take a COVID test, you turned it over, it was made in China. If you go down the drugstore aisle, all those medicines are made in China. We need to make sure we\\'re getting medicines made here or we need to get it from our friends so that we\\'re not, in any way, threatened.</p>\\n<p>But I\\'ll tell you, Ron continues to sit there and talk about China. He has done expansions in China. His biggest donor that is backed by China gave them $340,000. So, don\\'t go and talk about donors and money. Go to desantislies.com and we\\'ll tell you all about it.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Look, I know your record hurts. I know your record sometimes because you\\'re being -- you\\'re talking the opposite of what you did. You were made a big effort to bring them into the state.</p>\\n<p>They had land near military base. You were in front of the Chinese flags saying you work for them. You wrote a love letter to the ambassador. That\\'s well-documented. You were the number one Republican governor in the country.</p>\\n<p>And even people that on the media who are hostile to me, they look, they say they can\\'t find one instance of me as governor recruiting a Chinese company because I haven\\'t done it. It\\'s not been part of that.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Desantislies.com is on there. It\\'s on there.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And the Enterprise Florida, we actually eliminated.</p>\\n<p>So, here\\'s the thing though. She\\'s backed by companies like BlackRock. She\\'s backed by major companies on Wall Street. They make a lot of money in China. There\\'s a reason why you\\'re in the mess you are in terms of trying to deal with the inflation and everything because the elites in this country have sold out the middle of the country for China. She is part of that now. And she\\'s not going to stand up for you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> I want to ask about something that you mentioned you\\'ve been talking a lot about on the campaign trail, which is decoupling the U.S. economy with China\\'s. China is a top supplier of goods to the United States. The U.S. sells more than $150 billion of goods to China every year. Is it really possible to sever economic ties without inflicting major pain on American business and American consumers?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Sure it is, and it\\'s something that you\\'ve got to be strategic, you\\'ve got to be methodical about. You\\'ve got to focus on the things that are of national significance. For example, I don\\'t think it\\'s good idea that the pharmaceuticals come from there, things for our military weaponry, all these important things that if we got into a worldwide conflict, we\\'re going to ask China, who may be on the other side of that, to continue doing that.</p>\\n<p>So, you got to be smart about it. You got to recognize that you\\'re going to have to do some incentives here in this country, tax incentives, regulatory incentives. But I want to make things here again.</p>\\n<p>You know, I look around the country. There\\'s parts of Iowa that have been hollowed out, particularly in the eastern part. And I\\'ve talked to folks and seen what that did for the community. We were sold a bill of goods by a lot of elites in this country that somehow putting China and the WTO and granting a most favorite nation status was going to lead to our manufacturing exporting a bunch of stuff there. Instead, they\\'ve gobbled up so much more manufacturing.</p>\\n<p>I don\\'t think you can be a first rate power unless you have a very strong industrial base. So, we\\'re going to do that here. We\\'re going to work on workforce education. Not everyone needs to do a four-year Brick and Ivy University. That\\'s not the best way or only way for people to succeed. We\\'re going to do skilled trades. We\\'re going to do vocational. We\\'ve done that in Florida. It\\'s going to be a really, really big thing.</p>\\n<p>But I just think the middle of the country has to have those good- paying jobs and we can\\'t put the interest of some of the people on Wall Street over the interests of Americans on Main Street.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Let\\'s move on to Social Security. Let\\'s move on to Social Security. According to the Social Security Administration, Social Security will be unable to pay full benefits in a decade if no action is taken.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, you have said that you\\'re not going to, quote, mess with Social Security, unquote. Does that mean you have committed to never raising the retirement age and never cutting benefits?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So, all seniors out there, promise has been made to you. You\\'ve paid into this. Every single paycheck that you\\'ve had your entire life they\\'ve taken money out of, and that promise needs to be fulfilled.</p>\\n<p>So, that will happen when I\\'m president. Of course, I have a lot of seniors in Florida that depend on Social Security. I know many of them. And I think back to my own grandmother who was -- lived until 91. Social Security was her sole source of income. So, promise made, promise kept.</p>\\n<p>You know, on the retirement age, you know, there used to be people would say, well, life expectancy is going up. Shouldn\\'t it mirror that? Well, the problem now in the last five years is life expectancy is going down. So, I don\\'t see how you can raise the retirement age when our life expectancy is collapsing in this country. That\\'s a huge problem in and of itself.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ll work with both sides of the aisle. We\\'ll work on something for the long-term strengthening, but I am not going to mess with seniors\\' benefits. In this high-inflation environment, groceries are going through the roof, rent is going through the roof, all these staples, and you get a cost of living adjustment, but that\\'s not enough to cover the costs that have been increased.</p>\\n<p>So, seniors are really strapped, particularly those that are on fixed income, and they have to know that we\\'re going to deliver when it comes to their Social Security check.</p>\\n<p>Now, we\\'re going to get inflation down. We\\'re going to get energy costs down. There\\'s going to be a lot of things that are going to help seniors, but I think seniors should know promise made will be a promise kept.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So just a point of clarification, 15 seconds, removing current seniors from the equation, you\\'re not saying that you\\'re committing to never raising the retirement age or cutting benefits.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I would never raise the retirement age in the face of a declining life expectancy. I mean, I think that that would be really bad. I mean, just think about it, that hurts blue collar folks. You get taxed your entire life, life expectancy is down. You may not even be recouping very many benefits. And so life expectancy is declining. That\\'s a big problem.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Three years in a row, he voted to raise life expectancy to 70 years old, three years in a row. Go to desantislies.com and you\\'ll see it. So, now suddenly he\\'s going to tell you because he\\'s running for president and he\\'s not going to do it, you can\\'t trust him.</p>\\n<p>What I\\'ll tell you is Social Security is going to go bankrupt in ten years. Medicare is going to go bankrupt in eight. He talks about taking care of seniors right now, Florida is the inflation hotspot. It\\'s the highest cost of living of any state in the country. Seniors are having to leave because they can\\'t afford it. It\\'s documented in desantislies.com.</p>\\n<p>What I\\'ll tell you we have to do is we have to keep our promises to senior years, but we also can\\'t put our head in the sand for those like Ron saying they\\'re not going to touch Social Security. That means they\\'re going to leave after four or eight years and leave it bankrupt. No.</p>\\n<p>What we do is we go to those in their 20s and say we\\'re going to change the retirement age to reflect life expectancy. Instead of cost of living increases, we do increases based on inflation. We\\'d limit benefits on the wealthy and we expand Medicare advantage plans with seniors. That\\'s how we\\'ll deal with --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> With reducing the benefits, when you do the change in calculation, reducing the benefits, let\\'s just put this in perspective, under her administration, you would have seniors getting less cost of living adjustments while your tax dollars are going to pay the pensions of Ukrainian bureaucrats.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> That\\'s not true. That\\'s such a lie, Ron.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> You talk about putting Americans last. That is wrong. You\\'ve supported all that money going over there. So, let\\'s put our own people first.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> You\\'re so desperate. You\\'re just so desperate.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, let him speak.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And she also said -- she said recently that the age of Social Security is way too low, and I criticized that. And then she was called on it. And then she said, she never said it, of course, you\\'re lying. And then, sure enough, you put on the interview where she\\'s there, splitting image, and she says it\\'s way too low.</p>\\n<p>So, we can play this song and dance. She has a record. She makes statements. And I think part of the problem with her candidacy is now that she\\'s getting scrutiny, she\\'s got this problem with ballistic podiatry, shooting herself in the foot every other day, saying things that now she doesn\\'t even take questions from people.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, you want to raise the retirement age for younger Americans, but you have not said what that age should be. Should voters in their 20s plan on working until they\\'re 70?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, he hasn\\'t answered the fact that he voted to raise the retirement age to 73 different times. He can call me whatever name and be demeaning as much as he wants. It doesn\\'t change the fact that Ron is lying because Ron is losing. Everybody in the country sees it for what it is.</p>\\n<p>So, what I\\'ll tell you is, yes, we\\'re going to take on -- we\\'re going to be responsible with it and we\\'re going to go to those in our 20s.</p>\\n<p>When I said the retirement age was too low, again, where he\\'s lying, it\\'s because if you go, and you can go to desantislies.com, I said it\\'s too low, if we\\'re going to look at those in their 20s. We have to go and start looking at what we can do to get out of this. We want to make sure that everybody who was promised gets it.</p>\\n<p>But we also want to make sure our kids have something when they get it, too. So, the way we do that is exactly how I laid it out. Then we\\'ll know what we\\'re looking at and then we can start focusing.</p>\\n<p>The other thing is we need to start cutting spending in D.C. We have to go back to pre-COVID levels. That\\'s why I\\'ll veto any spending bill that doesn\\'t take us back to pre-COVID levels. That will save us trillions. We\\'ve got to go into every agency, replace the head of every agency and send people into every agency.</p>\\n<p>I did that as governor. Pull down old regs, pull down old programs, get rid of any problem children and clean those agencies out and get them mission-focused. There is a lot of waste in D.C. You need an accountant to go in there and clean it up. But we\\'re not going to take away from anyone else and he\\'s yet to answer the fact that he voted three times to raise the retirement age.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Just a clarification, Governor Haley, in 15 seconds, should voters in their 20s plan on having to work until they\\'re 70?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> They should plan on their retirement age being increased, yes. We\\'re going to change it to reflect more of what life expectancy should be.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, one of the things that I think we disagree on, too, is Governor Haley has said Social Security is an entitlement, but it\\'s not an entitlement. You\\'re paying into it. It\\'s not a welfare program. You\\'re being taxed for this your whole life. And so to expect to have benefits on the backend, I don\\'t think that that\\'s too much.</p>\\n<p>The other thing I\\'d point out is Social Security for decades ran massive surpluses. What happened to those surpluses? The Congress spent the surpluses.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Yes, when you paid the debt.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> They have a big problem with that. So, number one, we need term limits for members of Congress. Number two, we need a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Number three, we need to give the president a line item veto. And, number four, when you see all these Congressmen making a killing in the stock market, like Nancy Pelosi, she could run a very lucrative hedge fund, we need a 28th Amendment to the Constitution that says very simply Congress shall make no law respecting the citizens of the United States that does not also apply to members of Congress themselves.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> I want to turn now to the topic abortion, which, of course, has been hotly debated in this Republican primary campaign.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, last week Governor DeSantis said that former President Trump is not pro-life. Do you agree?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, look, I think that he did some pro-life things when he was president. You\\'d have to ask him. That\\'s why he should be on this debate stage.</p>\\n<p>Don\\'t ask me what President Trump thinks. You need to have him on this debate stage and ask him for yourself.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, look, I think that we\\'ve stood very strongly for a culture of life. Governor Reynolds is here. She has stood strongly for a culture of life and a national life protection. We\\'ve done it in the state of Florida. Donald Trump has attacked that.</p>\\n<p>What they did under Governor Reynolds here in Iowa, he said that that\\'s a, quote, terrible, terrible thing. I don\\'t know how you square that. He was at the March for Life when he was president his last year and he said that life\\'s a gift from God, that the unborn are made in the image of God and that you needed to have protections for that human life. And now saying it\\'s a terrible, terrible thing, he\\'s given a gift to the left to weaponize that against pro-lifers, and that\\'s wrong.</p>\\n<p>But here\\'s the thing. Republicans need to do a better job of lifting up folks who are having children. It\\'s very difficult to raise kids in this environment. You need the help with medical care. You need the help with affordability, and we need the help with education, choice. You got to be pro-life for the whole life, and you got to have some compassion for what is going on in this country.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Thank you, Governor. Oh, I\\'m sorry. Go ahead.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor, yesterday in Iowa, you criticized Governor Haley on this issue of abortion. You said she\\'s, quote, indulged in left wing tropes and chastised pro-lifers. Do you believe Governor Haley is sufficiently pro-life?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think she\\'s been confused on the issue. I think she\\'s trying to speak to different groups with different things. But when she says things like pro-lifers need to stop talking about throwing women in jail, that\\'s a trope. No one I\\'ve ever met thinks that that\\'s something that\\'s appropriate. These women are in vulnerable situations. They don\\'t get any help a lot of times from these fathers who don\\'t want to be there supportive. A lot of times they don\\'t have resources themselves.</p>\\n<p>So, it\\'s a very difficult situation and we\\'ve got to have compassion for those situations. But I think when she starts bringing that in, that\\'s using the language of the left to try to attack pro-lifers.</p>\\n<p>So, I think that that is wrong. But at the end of the day, I do agree with her on this. Donald Trump should be on this stage. He owes it to you here in Iowa to explain this change he\\'s had in his positioning, to explain why he has a tough time saying whether a man can become a woman or not, to explain why he wants to build a billion dollar-plus big, beautiful, new FBI building right in the heart of the swamp in Washington, D.C. He needs to explain why he didn\\'t build the wall and why he added $7.8 trillion to the debt.</p>\\n<p>Every candidate needs to earn your vote. Nobody is entitled to your vote. And he comes in here every now and then, he does his spiel, and then he leaves. I\\'ve shown up to all 99 counties because it\\'s important. You\\'re a servant of the people. You are not a ruler over the people. And that\\'s the type of president that I will be for you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I didn\\'t hear the criticism from Ron about me for being pro- life, but I\\'m not surprised. It\\'s something that he does all day, every day. I am unapologetically pro-life, not because the Republican Party tells me to be, but because my husband is adopted and I\\'ve got my two sweet children sitting in front of me and I had trouble having both of them.</p>\\n<p>These fellows don\\'t know how to talk about abortion. I have said over and over again, the Democrats put fear in women on abortion and Republicans have used judgment. This is too personal of an issue to put fear or judgment.</p>\\n<p>Our goal should be how do we save as many babies as possible and support as many moms as possible. That\\'s what we\\'re going to focus on doing. We\\'re not going to demonize this issue anymore. We\\'re not going to play politics with this issue anymore. We\\'re going to treat it like the respectful issue that it is.</p>\\n<p>And the tropes that you want to talk about, you keep saying, where is anybody talking about putting a woman in jail or giving her the death penalty? South Carolina. There is legislation right now that would put a woman in jail if she got an abortion. That\\'s why I say that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>So, I do want to remind the viewers at home, both governors have mentioned that they believe that Donald Trump should be here defending his own record. I just want to remind everybody that he did qualify for this debate and he did not accept our invitation.</p>\\n<p>Both of you talked about how important it is to protect the U.S. Constitution. Two years after losing the 2020 election, Donald Trump wrote on social media about his baseless election lies, quote, a massive fraud of this type and magnitude allows for the termination of all rules, regulations and articles, even those found in the Constitution, unquote. On that subject, former Vice President Mike Pence has said that on January 6th, 2021, Donald Trump put himself over the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, look, you take an oath to the Constitution, and I think what you\\'re seeing is Donald Trump basically said that the election was stolen. He went on and on talking about the election being stolen.</p>\\n<p>He said that January 6th was a beautiful day. I think January 6th was a terrible day and we should never want to see that happen again.</p>\\n<p>And I think we have to always be strong on the fact that, look, we want fair elections and we saw some discrepancies in those elections in 2020 that should be concerning. That\\'s why I passed voter I.D. in South Carolina. That\\'s why I think when absentee ballots go out, you should be able to verify signatures. That\\'s why I think ballots need to be counted on Election Day and you should get results on Election Day.</p>\\n<p>But that election, Trump lost it. Biden won that election. And the idea that he\\'s gone and carried this out forever to the point that he\\'s going to continue to say these things to scare the American people are wrong. We\\'ve seen a lot of states come together and do more election integrity bills. We need to do more than that. We still have three or four states that I\\'m worried about that don\\'t have that.</p>\\n<p>But at the end of the day, I will always defend and fight for the Constitution. That\\'s what we should do as Americans. I think what happened on January 6th was a terrible day and I think President Trump will have to answer for it.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, just a clarification, Governor, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I mean, I think that he says in January 6th was a beautiful day. I don\\'t think it was a beautiful day. I think you look at that. He thinks that he could go and bring in -- the fact that he wanted to change what the states did, the fact that he wanted to overturn the elections in D.C., those votes happen at the state level. You don\\'t ever allow in D.C. for those votes to be changed at the federal level.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> States rights matter.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, is there any meaningful difference in how you and Donald Trump view the Constitution?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> My role model for how to do the Constitution is George Washington. He said, the Constitution is the guide that I will never abandon. And I remember when I took an oath to be an officer in the U.S. Navy. You raise that hand, you put that left hand on the Bible. And it\\'s interesting, the oath doesn\\'t say that you\\'re going to defend the shores of the United States or engage in military conflict.</p>\\n<p>The oath simply says that you will support and defend the Constitution of the United States. As President of the United States, you will preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. You can\\'t just terminate the Constitution. I mean, I know he does word vomit from time to time on social media, but, obviously, I will uphold the Constitution.</p>\\n<p>And I think it\\'s fine to criticize Donald Trump, and I know the media brings it up a lot. But you know who else deserves to be criticized? The people that violated the Constitution during COVID to lock people out of schools, to destroy businesses, to force masks on people, to try to force vaccines. I\\'m going to bring a reckoning to all these agencies, the CDC, the NIH, the FDA, they harm people in this country. And when Dr. Fauci said there was no learning loss for kids, that\\'s a disgrace.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> There\\'s a reckoning coming.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, let\\'s talk about how you view the powers of the presidency because your opponent, Donald Trump, was in court yesterday for a hearing on presidential immunity. And, Governor DeSantis, I\\'m wondering if you agree with the argument that Donald Trump\\'s lawyer made in court that a president should have immunity for any conduct in office, including, as the judge asked, ordering the assassination of a political rival unless the president gets impeached and convicted by the Senate for the offense first.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, obviously, that attorney gave the case away on that explanation. I think the D.C. Circuit is going to rule against Donald Trump on that issue. I\\'m not exactly sure what the outer limits are. I don\\'t think it\\'s necessarily been litigated. It\\'s not going to be an issue with me, because I\\'m always going to follow the Constitution. And we\\'re going to uphold the best traditions of the office. And I\\'m going to be a president you can be proud of.</p>\\n<p>I think it\\'s important that people would be able to look to the president and say, hey, that\\'s somebody that\\'s worthy of emulating. And so my wife and I, we just view ourselves to try to do well for our kids and to make sure they\\'re proud of us. And we set a good example. So, that\\'s what we would do in that situation.</p>\\n<p>But I think there\\'s a larger issue Republicans have got to think of. Donald Trump is going to lose that appeal. He\\'s going to end up going to trial in front of a stacked left-wing D.C. jury of all Democrats. What are the odds that he\\'s going to get through that? And that\\'s even talking about the validity of the charges. I don\\'t think he gets through that.</p>\\n<p>And so what are we going to do as Republicans in terms of who we nominate for president? If Trump is the nominee, it\\'s going to be about January 6th, legal issues, criminal trials. The Democrats and the media would love to run with that.</p>\\n<p>I\\'m not running for my issues. I\\'m running for your issues. We need to make this election a referendum on the failures of Joe Biden, the failures of the Democratic Party, and how we have the formula to engineer a great comeback for this country. That\\'s what I would do.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley, Governor Haley, your response?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I\\'m sorry, I didn\\'t hear the question.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> The question was, do you agree with the argument Donald Trump\\'s lawyer made in court that a president should have immunity for any conduct, including ordering the assassination of a political rival unless that president is impeached and convicted by Senate for the defense first?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> No, that\\'s ridiculous. That\\'s absolutely ridiculous. I mean, we need to use some common sense here. You can\\'t go and kill a political rival and then claim, you know, immunity from a President. I think we have to start doing things that are right. And you know,</p>\\n<p>Ron said we should have leaders that we can look up to. Well, then stop lying because nobody\\'s going to want to look up to you if you\\'re lying.</p>\\n<p>But what I do think we need to look at is what is what has President Trump done? You look at the last few years and our country is completely divided. It\\'s divided over extremes. It\\'s divided over hatred, it\\'s divided over the fact that people think that if someone doesn\\'t agree with you that they\\'re bad.</p>\\n<p>And now we have leaders in our country that decide who\\'s good and who\\'s bad, who\\'s right and who\\'s wrong. That\\'s not what a leader does. What a leader does is they bring out the best in people and get them to see the way forward.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s what we need in our country. We don\\'t need this chaos anymore. We need someone who\\'s going to be a new generational leader that brings sanity back to America.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you so much. We\\'ll see you then. Republican Presidential Debate live from Drake University. We\\'ll be back right after this.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Welcome back to the CNN Presidential Debate live from Iowa, Drake University. Let\\'s start this with health care. Neither of you has released a detailed healthcare plan so we want to give some -- the voters here some insight into specifics of what you might do as President.</p>\\n<p>Governor Haley, as governor of South Carolina you chose not to expand Medicaid under Obamacare. Forty states including this one where we are in Iowa did expand Medicaid covering more than 18 million Americans. As President, would you allow those states to keep their expansions in place?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, the first thing is we have to look at the fact that how can we be the best country in the world with the most expensive health care in the world? And so the way we\\'re going to deal with it is we\\'re going to open it all up from the hospitals to the insurance companies to the doctor\\'s offices to the pharmaceuticals to the PBMs, make them have to show us everything.</p>\\n<p>Because right now, I can tell you, we take care of my parents. They\\'re 87 and 90. My dad is in the hospital right now. When my mom was in the hospital, a nurse came up to her to give her a couple of Tylenol. And she said, I don\\'t need them. And she said, honey, you might as well take them, because you\\'re going to pay for them anyway. When we got the bill from the hospital, no one talked to us about that.</p>\\n<p>Right now, you have insurance companies and hospitals deciding what it is for us. We\\'re going to take the patient out of the back seat and put them in the driver\\'s seat. We\\'re going to make sure that just like when you get your car fixed, and you go and they say, we can give you a temporary fix, and it\\'ll cost this much money, or we can give you a permanent fix, and it\\'s going to cost that much money. We\\'re going to go and make it transparent so that we can see everything so that they have to show us their words.</p>\\n<p>The second thing is we\\'re going to pass Tort Reform around this country. I did that in South Carolina. Doctors don\\'t give you those 10 tests because they want to. It\\'s for the 90 percent chance they\\'ll get sued. And then we\\'re going to go and eliminate Certificate of Need in this country. I did that in South Carolina, as well. That basically says if you have a hospital here, you can\\'t have another hospital for X number of miles.</p>\\n<p>They do the same thing for surgical centers, for nursing homes. We\\'re going to put competition back in health care so that health care is fighting for the patient. That way, services go up and costs go down.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor Haley, just a 15-second point of clarification. Would you allow the states that accepted Medicaid expansion to keep that?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> So, the problem with Medicaid is, it needs to be sent down as block grants. Governors can best decide how to do that. Whether they need to use it towards mental health, whether they need to use it towards support services.</p>\\n<p>Right now, I would send all of that down to the states. The problem is they\\'re only sending a small portion of it. They need to send more of that so that states can better take care of it.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis, your response on whether you would allow Iowa and the other 39 states who accepted Medicaid expansion to keep it.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, I\\'ve spoken with a lot of folks here in Iowa, and we need health care that\\'s accessible, that\\'s affordable, and that\\'s accountable. And particularly an emphasis on mental health. In every corner of this state, everywhere I\\'ve traveled in the campaign, people are really concerned about mental health with the kids in schools, people that are coming out of service to our country, with veterans, we\\'re going to put a big emphasis on mental health.</p>\\n<p>I\\'ve actually delivered on some of these things in Florida. We got accountability for the pharmacy benefit middlemen that are causing your drug prices to go up. So, we have transparency and consumers pay less. And I just beat the federal government to allow the state of Florida to buy prescription drugs from Canada, which is 25 cents on the dollar. What are prescription drugs cost? I want seniors to be able to do.</p>\\n<p>And then finally, we need to upend this COVID and medical authoritarian regime that we saw going around this country during COVID. It\\'s wrong to force vaxes like the COVID shot and say people are going to lose their jobs. That is not going to ever happen on my watch, trust me.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, same. Fifteen-second clarification.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I think what you do is you block-grant the program and then let states run the way they see fit to do. But I can tell you this, expanding Medicaid leads to less private coverage. It doesn\\'t necessarily increase access to quality care. I want to actually get people good health care. It\\'s not just about a sheet of paper if you don\\'t get any good doctors that get you entitled for that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor DeSantis mentioned mental health. Let\\'s talk about that. There is a mental health crisis in this country. An estimated 58 million Americans suffer from some type of mental health illness. Governor Haley, you say the mental health crisis is a quote, \"cancer that no one has dealt with\". What do you think is causing the crisis and what would you do to fix it?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> Well, I think we saw it exacerbated by COVID. I mean with the school lockdowns and everything else we see young people now with more anxiety, stress and depression than ever before. One in three people right now suffer from mental health issues, but if treated, they can live a perfectly normal life.</p>\\n<p>The problem is we don\\'t have enough mental health therapists. We don\\'t have enough mental health treatment centers. We don\\'t have enough addiction centers. And if you happen to be lucky enough to get one of those three, insurance doesn\\'t cover it.</p>\\n<p>We have got to start dealing with this, because it\\'s become a huge issue. And that\\'s why we need to have more Telehealth, so that people can get the mental health care they need right when they need it. We need to have mental health counselors in schools so they can identify when a child has a problem that they can get the help that they need. But right now, we\\'ve got to get access to care. And that\\'s, again, why I want to move those federal programs down to the state level, because states know they need more mental health support.</p>\\n<p>They\\'re not getting the dollars to do it. We don\\'t need D.C. bureaucrats handling that. We need this on the ground so that we can get the mental health centers, get the therapists, and get the help that people need so that they can be healthy again.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis, you said right here in Iowa this summer that closing mental health institutions, a policy supported by Ronald Reagan, was a mistake. As President, would you restore federal funding to those mental health institutions?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Yes, we need more people in institutionalized settings, unfortunately. But, you know, Governor Haley mentioned, I think, correctly, the devastating mental health consequences for these school closures, a lot of things that happened during COVID, I never recalled seeing her out there fighting the fight. I was on the front lines on that. Governor Kim Reynolds was on the front lines on that.</p>\\n<p>We fought back against the biomedical state. We were attacked by the media. We were attacked by the pharmaceutical companies. We were attacked by the left, attacked by Fauci. We stood and we helped people. And Iowa and Florida had the best schools opening in the entire pandemic because we led. That\\'s what you want to do.</p>\\n<p>Now, in terms of mental health, I\\'ve run into veterans here in Iowa, and I think we have a significant problem with veterans, particularly the post-9-11 veterans, and we know the stats on suicide. It\\'s really, really sad. And as a fellow veteran, as President, I have to put that issue on the front burner.</p>\\n<p>We can\\'t keep turning a blind eye to what\\'s happening to our vets. It\\'s not going to be done just through the VA. And it can\\'t be done just by pumping people with pharmaceuticals. If a veteran has post- traumatic stress, you need more than just that. So, we\\'re going to use the VA to link veterans with resources that are throughout our country.</p>\\n<p>For example, in Florida, we have an organization that trains service dogs to be able to be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. They understand the symptoms, they mitigate it, and you know what? The suicide rate is close to zero as a result of that. We got to think bigger than these bureaucracies, and we\\'ve got to be there for our vets and their mental health.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Turning -- turning to the topic of climate, 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded on Earth, and Americans are already feeling the impact. Just yesterday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the U.S. experienced 28 weather and climate-related disasters that cost at least $1 billion last year -- another record.</p>\\n<p>Governor DeSantis, here in Florida. I\\'m sorry, Governor DeSantis, here in Iowa, massive flooding has left farmers underwater. In Florida, rising seas threaten coastal cities. You have taken action in your home state to mitigate the problems of rising seas. But as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> So, on day one as President, we take Biden\\'s Green New Deal. We tear it up and we throw it in the trash can. It is bad for this country. We have to have reliable energy. And here\\'s the thing, you know, they talk about -- Joe Biden has said that global warming is worse than a nuclear war. And I\\'m just thinking to myself, well, gee, John Kerry hasn\\'t given up his private jet. Obama hasn\\'t given up his Martha\\'s Vineyard seaside mansion. I haven\\'t seen Biden do anything to hold China accountable except making sure that Hunter gets his money.</p>\\n<p>So, these guys talk out of one side of their mouth and then they behave in another way. And I think that\\'s wrong. But I also think that those policies would devastate communities, particularly here in Iowa. I mean, for example, he wants to mandate electric vehicles. That\\'s going to be more costly.</p>\\n<p>I think the car companies would go bankrupt, but it\\'s going to hurt liquid fuels, which is very, very important. You\\'re going to end up having rolling blackouts if they kneecap reliable energy production in this country. Florida\\'s had a massive decline in emissions -- wasn\\'t because of a single mandate.</p>\\n<p>It was because of innovation, because a lot of natural gas has replaced coal. We do have market-based solar, and it\\'s a compliment, but we cannot walk away from reliable energy. And I think about, here\\'s what the left wants to do. They want to take away your freedom, and they want you to pay more for everything.</p>\\n<p>We need you to pay less for energy. And we need to make sure people can innovate. We cannot have these mandates and they\\'ll be gone the day I\\'m President.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> So, Governor, just a point of clarification -- 15 seconds. A recent research at the University of Iowa ties these floods in Iowa to the rise in greenhouse gases.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> And here\\'s the thing, Jake, I appreciate that.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Let me just ask the question. As President, would you do anything to deal with this underlying cause?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Innovate, and here\\'s the thing. China is building two coal plants a week. You can do everything Biden wants to do and you\\'re going to have way more of what China\\'s increasing it. So, why would we be cutting off our nose to spite our face? China is the problem here, and so hold them accountable.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> But don\\'t hold the American people to less opportunity.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. Governor Haley, as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause of the floods and other climate disasters, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I mean, first of all, regardless of what party, everybody wants to have clean air, clean water. They want a world that they can pass on to their kids that\\'s going to be healthy and all of that. But it\\'s how do we do that? I think the first thing we have to understand is you don\\'t deal in extremes.</p>\\n<p>When I was at the United Nations, the reason I took us out of the Paris climate agreement was because President Obama had put all these mandates down on our businesses, but they didn\\'t do anything to hold China and India to account. Those are the two countries we have to really go to if we care about the environment, that we go and make them be held accountable.</p>\\n<p>The second thing is we\\'ll roll back all of Biden\\'s green subsidies because they\\'re misplaced. Rather than putting anything towards innovation on what we can do on nuclear fusion and other things that reduce emissions, which there are things out there, to go and have everybody have to drive an electric car by 2035. That\\'s not even smart. One, because which, by the way, Ron took Biden\\'s stimulus money and did charging stations all throughout Florida. I wouldn\\'t have taken the stimulus money. But what that does is basically, we don\\'t have the infrastructure. And I\\'m not just talking about charging stations. Electric vehicles are heavy. Our roads and bridges wouldn\\'t be able to handle that if we did that because they\\'re heavy in weight.</p>\\n<p>And so we have to be smart about the way we do that. Not to mention 70 percent of the batteries in electric cars are made in China. So, Biden gave this massive windfall to our number one national security threat. If we\\'re going to do it, innovate it, transition and do it the right way, not in extremes.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. I want to turn to the issue of crime. The majority of Americans describe crime in the U.S. as either extremely or very serious. Recent data show crime rates falling, but some violent crime rates do remain high. Governor Haley, former President Trump, suggested that he might try to stop violent crime by deploying U.S. troops to democratic-run states and cities, something he could potentially do under the Insurrection Act. Is that something that you would do as President?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> What I would do is, first of all, defund sanctuary cities. It\\'s hugely important that we do that. That\\'s where we\\'re seeing a lot of crime. But the second thing is, our law enforcement is demoralized right now. Because if they go and they arrest someone for having a stolen gun, it\\'s demoralizing when they go through all that effort, put their lives at risk, and then you turn around and let that criminal go the very next day.</p>\\n<p>Prosecutors need to prosecute according to the law and we\\'ve got to start holding them accountable. When we bring law and order back to our cities, then that\\'s when they\\'ll be safe. You don\\'t do it by defunding the police, and you don\\'t do it by just praising the police.</p>\\n<p>You do it by having their backs, making sure we pass the first Body Camera Bill in the country in South Carolina, to make sure that law enforcement felt like they could do their job without anyone -- without feeling threatened about them doing their job.</p>\\n<p>But we have to have prosecutors prosecuting. We have to defund sanctuary cities. We have to get these stolen guns and drugs off the street. And the only way we can do that is when we empower law enforcement.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> I just think, I mean, that quote from the President, former president Trump is a little bit rich because he was President during the worst rioting in the modern history of this country, the BLM riots in the summer of 2020. When I saw that happening in Minneapolis, in Florida, I called out the National Guard. We had state law enforcement deployed.</p>\\n<p>We said, you\\'re not burning down our cities in this state. And you know what? It didn\\'t happen. He sat in the White House and tweeted law and order, but he did nothing to ensure law and order. As your President, I will never let our cities burn. You have every right to stop this runaway rioting as President. In fact, you have a duty.</p>\\n<p>Now, Nikki Haley and I have a disagreement on the BLM stuff, too, because she tweeted during this period of time that the death of George Floyd should be, quote, \"personal and painful for each and every American\".</p>\\n<p>But people in Iowa had nothing to do with that, or Florida or South Carolina, she was virtue signaling to the left, she was accepting the narrative, and she was trying to impress people who were never going to like us.</p>\\n<p>I never bought in to going after the police, we backed the Blue to the state of Florida, and we\\'re about lower crime as a result of that.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Thank you. Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> It\\'s interesting that he did that. He put a tweet that was very similar.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> That\\'s not true.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> But let me tell you why I did that. First of all, we had one of the worst racial shootings. We had the shooting of Walter Scott who was shot seven times in the back by a dirty cop. We had a horrific shooting at a church where a white supremacist came in and killed nine amazing souls.</p>\\n<p>BLM, all of that, we never had to deal with riots. We never had to call in the National Guard, Ron, because when we had both of those shootings, we were able to pull people together. We didn\\'t have riots, we had vigils. We didn\\'t have protests, we had prayer. We brought people together.</p>\\n<p>When I said that about George Floyd, when we turned around and had the worst shooting in a religious place that we had seen in this country, not only did I pass the first Body Camera Bill in the country and keep our state together, not only did I move to bring the Confederate flag down, we came together as a state in prayer --</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you Governor.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> -- and we had no division, no riots, no anything.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> We didn\\'t need the National Guard because a leader knows how to bring out the best of the people.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Thank you, Governor. So, you have been sparring on the campaign trail for months. We\\'ve seen some vicious attack ads going back and forth, and tonight we have had a very lively debate. On a different note, Governor DeSantis, let me ask you, what do you admire about Governor Haley?</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, look, I mean, I think that, you know, at the United Nations, I did think that she spoke out strongly on some key issues, and I appreciated that. I also appreciate the state of South Carolina. My wife is a College of Charleston graduate. Her parents lived there for many, many years.</p>\\n<p>And so, it is a wonderful state. There\\'s a lot of great people there. And I think to be able to have been Governor there is a great achievement. And I really appreciate everyone I\\'ve gotten to meet in South Carolina.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Governor Haley, what do you admire about Governor DeSantis?</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> I think he\\'s been a good governor.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Okay. So, we\\'re going to squeeze in another quick break. And we\\'ll be right back with more from the Republican debates here at Drake University.</p>\\n<p>[<i>commercial break</i>]</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> We\\'re back live from Des Moines, Iowa in the CNN Republican Presidential Debate. We now have time for closing statements and we begin with Governor Haley.</p>\\n<p><b>HALEY:</b> First of all, I want to thank the good people of Iowa. I have campaigned for 11 months, whether it\\'s driving a combine or holding a pig at a produce area or whether it\\'s the fact that we\\'ve met owners of bakeries and small businesses.</p>\\n<p>You know, every one of them knows that we can\\'t go through four more years of chaos. And if it\\'s Donald Trump, there will be four more years of chaos. And we can\\'t be a country in disarray in a world on fire and go through four more years of chaos. And we can\\'t go through another nail-biter of an election.</p>\\n<p>And if you look at the polls right now, going against Joe Biden, in every one of those head-to-head polls, Ron doesn\\'t beat Joe Biden. Trump is head-to-head. On a good day, he might be up by two points. I defeat Biden by 17 points. That\\'s bigger than the presidency.</p>\\n<p>That\\'s House, that\\'s Senate, that\\'s governorships, that\\'s down to school board. That\\'s a mandate to get our spending under control and get inflation down. That\\'s a mandate to get our kids reading again and go back to the basics in education. That\\'s a mandate to secure our borders with no more excuses. That\\'s a mandate to bring law and order back to our country and that\\'s a mandate for a strong America that we can be proud of.</p>\\n<p>We can do this. I know we can do this. If you will join with me in this movement, if you join with me in this fight, I promise you our best days are to come. God bless you.</p>\\n<p><b>BASH:</b> Governor DeSantis.</p>\\n<p><b>DESANTIS:</b> Well, it\\'s been great to visit all 99 counties here in Iowa. I\\'ve been able to meet so many friends and really learn about some of the best of America. Iowa\\'s votes do not need to be corrected by any other state. You all know what you\\'re doing. And we have an opportunity on Monday to really change the course of history.</p>\\n<p>Donald Trump\\'s running for his issues. Nikki Haley\\'s running for her donors\\' issues. I\\'m running for your issues, your family\\'s issues, and solely to turn this country around. I\\'m the only one running that\\'s delivered on 100 percent of my promises. And I\\'m the only one running that has beaten the left time and time again, from the teachers\\' unions, to Fauci, to the Democratic Party.</p>\\n<p>We need to run under the banner of bold colors that are putting the American people first. We can\\'t run under a banner of pale pastels of the warmed-over corporatism, the likes of which is practiced by Nikki Haley. Freedom is on the ballot. Decline is a choice. We have it within our power to fix this country and to turn it around.</p>\\n<p>I am asking for your support in the Iowa caucus on Monday, January 15th. I\\'ll be a President that you can be proud of and I promise you this, I will get the job done and I will not let you down. Thank you and God bless you all.</p>\\n<p><b>TAPPER:</b> Our thanks to Governor DeSantis and Governor Haley. Governor DeSantis and Governor Haley, thank you so much both of you for being here tonight. Thanks to our audience, to our host, Drake University. For Dana Bash and the whole CNN team, I\\'m Jake Tapper. Thank you so much for watching. Be sure to join us Monday, January 15th at 4 P.M. Eastern for CNN\\'s coverage of the Iowa caucuses. Anderson Cooper and Kaitlan Collins are going to pick it up right now with more on the debate.

       " 'BASH: Thank you, Governor. Governor DeSantis mentioned mental health. Let\\'s talk about that. There is a mental health crisis in this country. An estimated 58 million Americans suffer from some type of mental health illness. Governor Haley, you say the mental health crisis is a quote, \"cancer that no one has dealt with\". What do you think is causing the crisis and what would you do to fix it?',\n",
       " 'HALEY: Well, I think we saw it exacerbated by COVID. I mean with the school lockdowns and everything else we see young people now with more anxiety, stress and depression than ever before. One in three people right now suffer from mental health issues, but if treated, they can live a perfectly normal life.',\n",
       " \"The problem is we don't have enough mental health therapists. We don't have enough mental health treatment centers. We don't have enough addiction centers. And if you happen to be lucky enough to get one of those three, insurance doesn't cover it.\",\n",
       " \"We have got to start dealing with this, because it's become a huge issue. And that's why we need to have more Telehealth, so that people can get the mental health care they need right when they need it. We need to have mental health counselors in schools so they can identify when a child has a problem that they can get the help that they need. But right now, we've got to get access to care. And that's, again, why I want to move those federal programs down to the state level, because states know they need more mental health support.\",\n",
       " \"They're not getting the dollars to do it. We don't need D.C. bureaucrats handling that. We need this on the ground so that we can get the mental health centers, get the therapists, and get the help that people need so that they can be healthy again.\",\n",
       " 'BASH: Governor DeSantis, you said right here in Iowa this summer that closing mental health institutions, a policy supported by Ronald Reagan, was a mistake. As President, would you restore federal funding to those mental health institutions?',\n",
       " 'DESANTIS: Yes, we need more people in institutionalized settings, unfortunately. But, you know, Governor Haley mentioned, I think, correctly, the devastating mental health consequences for these school closures, a lot of things that happened during COVID, I never recalled seeing her out there fighting the fight. I was on the front lines on that. Governor Kim Reynolds was on the front lines on that.',\n",
       " \"We fought back against the biomedical state. We were attacked by the media. We were attacked by the pharmaceutical companies. We were attacked by the left, attacked by Fauci. We stood and we helped people. And Iowa and Florida had the best schools opening in the entire pandemic because we led. That's what you want to do.\",\n",
       " \"Now, in terms of mental health, I've run into veterans here in Iowa, and I think we have a significant problem with veterans, particularly the post-9-11 veterans, and we know the stats on suicide. It's really, really sad. And as a fellow veteran, as President, I have to put that issue on the front burner.\",\n",
       " \"We can't keep turning a blind eye to what's happening to our vets. It's not going to be done just through the VA. And it can't be done just by pumping people with pharmaceuticals. If a veteran has post- traumatic stress, you need more than just that. So, we're going to use the VA to link veterans with resources that are throughout our country.\",\n",
       " \"For example, in Florida, we have an organization that trains service dogs to be able to be paired with veterans with post-traumatic stress. They understand the symptoms, they mitigate it, and you know what? The suicide rate is close to zero as a result of that. We got to think bigger than these bureaucracies, and we've got to be there for our vets and their mental health.\",\n",
       " 'TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. Turning -- turning to the topic of climate, 2023 was the hottest year ever recorded on Earth, and Americans are already feeling the impact. Just yesterday, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reported that the U.S. experienced 28 weather and climate-related disasters that cost at least $1 billion last year -- another record.',\n",
       " \"Governor DeSantis, here in Florida. I'm sorry, Governor DeSantis, here in Iowa, massive flooding has left farmers underwater. In Florida, rising seas threaten coastal cities. You have taken action in your home state to mitigate the problems of rising seas. But as President, would you do anything to deal with the underlying cause, which scientists agree requires cutting carbon emissions?\",\n",
       " \"DESANTIS: So, on day one as President, we take Biden's Green New Deal. We tear it up and we throw it in the trash can. It is bad for this country. We have to have reliable energy. And here's the thing, you know, they talk about -- Joe Biden has said that global warming is worse than a nuclear war. And I'm just thinking to myself, well, gee, John Kerry hasn't given up his private jet. Obama hasn't given up his Martha's Vineyard seaside mansion. I haven't seen Biden do anything to hold China accountable except making sure that Hunter gets his money.\",\n",
       " \"So, these guys talk out of one side of their mouth and then they behave in another way. And I think that's wrong. But I also think that those policies would devastate communities, particularly here in Iowa. I mean, for example, he wants to mandate electric vehicles. That's going to be more costly.\",\n",
       " \"I think the car companies would go bankrupt, but it's going to hurt liquid fuels, which is very, very important. You're going to end up having rolling blackouts if they kneecap reliable energy production in this country. Florida's had a massive decline in emissions -- wasn't because of a single mandate.\",\n",
       " \"It was because of innovation, because a lot of natural gas has replaced coal. We do have market-based solar, and it's a compliment, but we cannot walk away from reliable energy. And I think about, here's what the left wants to do. They want to take away your freedom, and they want you to pay more for everything.\",\n",
       " \"We need you to pay less for energy. And we need to make sure people can innovate. We cannot have these mandates and they'll be gone the day I'm President.\",\n",
       " 'TAPPER: So, Governor, just a point of clarification -- 15 seconds. A recent research at the University of Iowa ties these floods in Iowa to the rise in greenhouse gases.',\n",
       " \"DESANTIS: And here's the thing, Jake, I appreciate that.\",\n",
       " 'TAPPER: Let me just ask the question. As President, would you do anything to deal with this underlying cause?',\n",
       " \"DESANTIS: Innovate, and here's the thing. China is building two coal plants a week. You can do everything Biden wants to do and you're going to have way more of what China's increasing it. So, why would we be cutting off our nose to spite our face? China is the problem here, and so hold them accountable.\",\n",

       " \"HALEY: I mean, first of all, regardless of what party, everybody wants to have clean air, clean water. They want a world that they can pass on to their kids that's going to be healthy and all of that. But it's how do we do that? I think the first thing we have to understand is you don't deal in extremes.\",\n",
       " \"When I was at the United Nations, the reason I took us out of the Paris climate agreement was because President Obama had put all these mandates down on our businesses, but they didn't do anything to hold China and India to account. Those are the two countries we have to really go to if we care about the environment, that we go and make them be held accountable.\",\n",
       " \"The second thing is we'll roll back all of Biden's green subsidies because they're misplaced. Rather than putting anything towards innovation on what we can do on nuclear fusion and other things that reduce emissions, which there are things out there, to go and have everybody have to drive an electric car by 2035. That's not even smart. One, because which, by the way, Ron took Biden's stimulus money and did charging stations all throughout Florida. I wouldn't have taken the stimulus money. But what that does is basically, we don't have the infrastructure. And I'm not just talking about charging stations. Electric vehicles are heavy. Our roads and bridges wouldn't be able to handle that if we did that because they're heavy in weight.\",\n",
       " \"And so we have to be smart about the way we do that. Not to mention 70 percent of the batteries in electric cars are made in China. So, Biden gave this massive windfall to our number one national security threat. If we're going to do it, innovate it, transition and do it the right way, not in extremes.\",\n",
       " 'BASH: Thank you. I want to turn to the issue of crime. The majority of Americans describe crime in the U.S. as either extremely or very serious. Recent data show crime rates falling, but some violent crime rates do remain high. Governor Haley, former President Trump, suggested that he might try to stop violent crime by deploying U.S. troops to democratic-run states and cities, something he could potentially do under the Insurrection Act. Is that something that you would do as President?',\n",
       " \"HALEY: What I would do is, first of all, defund sanctuary cities. It's hugely important that we do that. That's where we're seeing a lot of crime. But the second thing is, our law enforcement is demoralized right now. Because if they go and they arrest someone for having a stolen gun, it's demoralizing when they go through all that effort, put their lives at risk, and then you turn around and let that criminal go the very next day.\",\n",
       " \"Prosecutors need to prosecute according to the law and we've got to start holding them accountable. When we bring law and order back to our cities, then that's when they'll be safe. You don't do it by defunding the police, and you don't do it by just praising the police.\",\n",

When I saw that happening in Minneapolis, in Florida, I called out the National Guard. We had state law enforcement deployed.',\n",

We had a horrific shooting at a church where a white supremacist came in and killed nine amazing souls.',\n",
       " \"BLM, all of that, we never had to deal with riots. We never had to call in the National Guard, Ron, because when we had both of those shootings, we were able to pull people together.

       "['CLINTON: Well, thank you. Are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that’s a very good question, because I’ve heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we’re good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity, and we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl, as well as every adult, to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That’s why the slogan of my campaign is “Stronger Together,” because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals—and I’ve set forth some big goals, getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable, and so much else. If we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them, there’s nothing in my opinion that America can’t do. So that’s why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I’m hoping to earn your vote, I’m hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you, I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans, regardless of your political beliefs, where you come from, what you look like, your religion. I want us to heal our country and bring it together because that’s, I think, the best way for us to get the future that our children and our grandchildren deserve.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, like everyone else, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking over the last 48 hours about what we heard and saw. You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them on politics, policies, principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women, what he thinks about women, what he does to women. And he has said that the video doesn’t represent who he is. But I think it’s clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we’ve seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We’ve seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking them from one to ten. We’ve seen him embarrass women on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms. So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it’s not only women, and it’s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president, because he has also targeted immigrants, African-Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is. And the question for us, the question our country must answer is that this is not who we are. That’s why—to go back to your question—I want to send a message—we all should—to every boy and girl and, indeed, to the entire world that America already is great, but we are great because we are good, and we will respect one another, and we will work with one another, and we will celebrate our diversity. These are very important values to me, because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I’m so fortunate enough to become your president.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, first, let me start by saying that so much of what he’s just said is not right, but he gets to run his campaign any way he chooses. He gets to decide what he wants to talk about. Instead of answering people’s questions, talking about our agenda, laying out the plans that we have that we think can make a better life and a better country, that’s his choice. When I hear something like that, I am reminded of what my friend, Michelle Obama, advised us all: When they go low, you go high. [applause] And, look, if this were just about one video, maybe what he’s saying tonight would be understandable, but everyone can draw their own conclusions at this point about whether or not the man in the video or the man on the stage respects women. But he never apologizes for anything to anyone. He never apologized to Mr. and Mrs. Khan, the Gold Star family whose son, Captain Khan, died in the line of duty in Iraq. And Donald insulted and attacked them for weeks over their religion. He never apologized to the distinguished federal judge who was born in Indiana, but Donald said he couldn’t be trusted to be a judge because his parents were, quote, “Mexican.” He never apologized to the reporter that he mimicked and mocked on national television and our children were watching. And he never apologized for the racist lie that President Obama was not born in the United States of America. He owes the president an apology, he owes our country an apology, and he needs to take responsibility for his actions and his words.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: … because everything he just said is absolutely false, but I’m not surprised.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: In the first debate…[laughter]',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: … I told people that it would be impossible to be fact-checking Donald all the time. I’d never get to talk about anything I want to do and how we’re going to really make lives better for people. So, once again, go to HillaryClinton.com. We have literally Trump—you can fact check him in real time. Last time at the first debate, we had millions of people fact checking, so I expect we’ll have millions more fact checking, because, you know, it is—it’s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, Martha, first, let me say—and I’ve said before, but I’ll repeat it, because I want everyone to hear it—that was a mistake, and I take responsibility for using a personal e-mail account. Obviously, if I were to do it over again, I would not. I’m not making any excuses. It was a mistake. And I am very sorry about that. But I think it’s also important to point out where there are some misleading accusations from critics and others. After a year-long investigation, there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server I was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all—anyone who says otherwise has no basis—that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands. I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I was privy to a lot of classified material. Obviously, as secretary of state, I had some of the most important secrets that we possess, such as going after Bin Laden. So I am very committed to taking classified information seriously. And as I said, there is no evidence that any classified information ended up in the wrong hands.',\n",

       " 'CLINTON: I didn’t in the first debate, and I’m going to try not to in this debate, because I’d like to get to the questions that the people have brought here tonight to talk to us about.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: OK, Donald. I know you’re into big diversion tonight, anything to avoid talking about your campaign and the way it’s exploding and the way Republicans are leaving you. But let’s at least focus…',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: … on some of the issues that people care about tonight. Let’s get to their questions.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: If he wants to start, he can start. No, go ahead, Donald.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, I think Donald was about to say he’s going to solve it by repealing it and getting rid of the Affordable Care Act. And I’m going to fix it, because I agree with you. Premiums have gotten too high. Copays, deductibles, prescription drug costs, and I’ve laid out a series of actions that we can take to try to get those costs down. But here’s what I don’t want people to forget when we’re talking about reining in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president, when the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn’t just that 20 million people got insurance who didn’t have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time, and they tell me what a difference having that insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can’t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women can’t be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you’re under 26, and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26, something that didn’t happen before. So I want very much to save what works and is good about the Affordable Care Act. But we’ve got to get costs down. We’ve got to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again, all of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody, not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange. And then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at 90 percent health insurance coverage. That’s the highest we’ve ever been in our country.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: So I want us to get to 100 percent, but get costs down and keep quality up.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: No, I mean, he clarified what he meant. And it’s very clear. Look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That’s where the vast majority of people get their health care. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor and couldn’t put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid. Obviously, Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great job doing it, by the way, and then all of the people who were employed, but people who were working but didn’t have the money to afford insurance and didn’t have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take. And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance. So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald’s not telling you is we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be, and that means the insurance companies…',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: … get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I’m sorry, you’ve got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma…',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: … you may not be able to have insurance because you can’t afford it. So let’s fix what’s broken about it, but let’s not throw it away and give it all back to the insurance companies and the drug companies. That’s not going to work.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, thank you for asking your question. And I’ve heard this question from a lot of Muslim-Americans across our country, because, unfortunately, there’s been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims. And even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army, has been subject to attack by Donald. I want to say just a couple of things. First, we’ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we’ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particularly well-known one with Muhammad Ali. My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place, if you’re willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community. That’s what America is. That’s what we want America to be for our children and our grandchildren. It’s also very short-sighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I’ve worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I’ve met with a lot of them, and I’ve heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that’s what I want to see. It’s also important I intend to defeat ISIS, to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now, a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, why should we cooperate with the Americans? And this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists, violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam. And it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are. So I want a country where citizens like you and your family are just as welcome as anyone else.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, first of all, I will not let anyone into our country that I think poses a risk to us. But there are a lot of refugees, women and children—think of that picture we all saw of that 4-year-old boy with the blood on his forehead because he’d been bombed by the Russian and Syrian air forces. There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely, I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are. But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts and others. But it is important for us as a policy, you know, not to say, as Donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are a country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own county? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those? So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous. And indeed, you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites, and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters, because they want to create a war between us. And the final thing I would say, this is the 10th or 12th time that he’s denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it. It’s been debunked, but it never stops him from saying whatever he wants to say.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: So, please…',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: … go to HillaryClinton.com and you can see it.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, right. As I recall, that was something I said about Abraham Lincoln after having seen the wonderful Steven Spielberg movie called “Lincoln.” It was a master class watching President Lincoln get the Congress to approve the 13th Amendment. It was principled, and it was strategic. And I was making the point that it is hard sometimes to get the Congress to do what you want to do and you have to keep working at it. And, yes, President Lincoln was trying to convince some people, he used some arguments, convincing other people, he used other arguments. That was a great—I thought a great display of presidential leadership. But, you know, let’s talk about what’s really going on here, Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that, as are other sites where the Russians hack information, we don’t even know if it’s accurate information, and then they put it out. We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election. And believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. They’re doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump. Now, maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow, I don’t know the reasons. But we deserve answers. And we should demand that Donald release all of his tax returns so that people can see what are the entanglements and the financial relationships that he has…',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: … with the Russians and other foreign powers.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, everything you’ve heard just now from Donald is not true. I’m sorry I have to keep saying this, but he lives in an alternative reality. And it is sort of amusing to hear somebody who hasn’t paid federal income taxes in maybe 20 years talking about what he’s going to do. But I’ll tell you what he’s going to do. His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they’ve ever had, more than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes care of Donald and people like Donald, and this would be a massive gift. And, indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now, here’s what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than $250,000 a year—and that’s the vast majority of Americans as you know—will have their taxes raised, because I think we’ve got to go where the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And, yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes. I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of when he claimed a billion-dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It’s called the Buffett rule. Yes, Warren Buffett is the one who’s gone out and said somebody like him should not be paying a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above $5 million. We have to make up for lost times, because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families. And I think it’s been unfortunate, but it’s happened, that since the Great Recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald, who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education, that is wrong.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: And we’re going to make sure that nobody, no corporation, and no individual can get away without paying his fair share to support our country.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, here we go again. I’ve been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years, starting when I was a senator from New York. But that’s not the point here.',\n",

       " 'CLINTON: I will be the president and we will get it done. That’s exactly right.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: You know, under our Constitution, presidents have something called veto power. Look, he has now said repeatedly, “30 years this and 30 years that.” So let me talk about my 30 years in public service. I’m very glad to do so. Eight million kids every year have health insurance, because when I was first lady I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get health care for our first responders who were suffering because they had run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and Reserve members have health care because of work that I did, and children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done. When I was secretary of state, I went around the world advocating for our country, but also advocating for women’s rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons. Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be re-elected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: And I’ve proven that I can, and for 30 years, I’ve produced results for people.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, the situation in Syria is catastrophic. And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian air force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn’t paid any attention to ISIS. They’re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was secretary of state, advocated and I advocate today a no-fly zone and safe zones. We need some leverage with the Russians, because they are not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution, unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia. Russia has decided that it’s all in, in Syria. And they’ve also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too, and it’s not me. I’ve stood up to Russia. I’ve taken on Putin and others, and I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that’s fine. And I did as secretary of state. That’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It’s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage than we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes, war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.',\n",

I don’t think American troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. I don’t think that is a smart strategy. I do think the use of special forces, which we’re using, the use of enablers and trainers in Iraq, which has had some positive effects, are very much in our interests, and so I do support what is happening, but let me just…',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, Martha, I hope that by the time I—if I’m fortunate…',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: I hope by the time I am president that we will have pushed ISIS out of Iraq. I do think that there is a good chance that we can take Mosul. And, you know, Donald says he knows more about ISIS than the generals. No, he doesn’t. There are a lot of very important planning going on, and some of it is to signal to the Sunnis in the area, as well as Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, that we all need to be in this. And that takes a lot of planning and preparation. I would go after Baghdadi. I would specifically target Baghdadi, because I think our targeting of Al Qaida leaders—and I was involved in a lot of those operations, highly classified ones—made a difference. So I think that could help. I would also consider arming the Kurds. The Kurds have been our best partners in Syria, as well as Iraq. And I know there’s a lot of concern about that in some circles, but I think they should have the equipment they need so that Kurdish and Arab fighters on the ground are the principal way that we take Raqqa after pushing ISIS out of Iraq.',\n",
       " 'CLINTON: Well, 67 percent of the people voted to re-elect me when I ran for my second term, and I was very proud and very humbled by that. Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school, I went to work for the Children’s Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the 30 years I’ve been in public service. I’m proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education, something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos—one of my first jobs in politics was down in south Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote. So I have a deep devotion, to use your absolutely correct word, to making sure that every American feels like he or she has a place in our country. And I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn’t have a place in Donald Trump’s America. They write me, and one woman wrote me about her son, Felix. She adopted him from Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He’s 10 years old now. This is the only country he’s ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected? You know, children listen to what is being said. To go back to the very, very first question. And there’s a lot of fear—in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up. A lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy. A lot of kids are expressing their concerns. So, first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody.',\n",

It’s with him and with the hateful and divisive campaign that he has run, and the inciting of violence at his rallies, and the very brutal kinds of comments about not just women, but all Americans, all kinds of Americans. And what he has said about African-Americans and Latinos, about Muslims, about POWs, about immigrants, about people with disabilities, he’s never apologized for. And so I do think that a lot of the tone and tenor that he has said—I’m proud of the campaign that Bernie Sanders and I ran. We ran a campaign based on issues, not insults. And he is supporting me 100 percent.',\n",

But it’s in part because those of us who have had the great privilege of seeing this job up close and know how difficult it is, and it’s not just because I watched my husband take a $300 billion deficit and turn it into a $200 billion surplus, and 23 million new jobs were created, and incomes went up for everybody. Everybody. African-American incomes went up 33 percent. And it’s not just because I worked with George W. Bush after 9/11, and I was very proud that when I told him what the city needed, what we needed to recover, he said you’ve got it, and he never wavered. He stuck with me. And I have worked and I admire President Obama. He inherited the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. That was a terrible time for our country.',\n",

       " 'CLINTON: Thank you. Well, you’re right. This is one of the most important issues in this election. I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge and then gotten on the bench, but, you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against. Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United and get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn’t agree with that. I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country, that we don’t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality. Now, Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider. And among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you’re wealthy and you can give more money to something doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have any more rights than anybody else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court. And I regret deeply that the Senate has not done its job and they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama, a highly qualified person, they’ve not given him a vote to be able to be have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices. I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president, I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that, we have nine justices that get to work on behalf of our people.',\n",

First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings, putting steelworkers and American steel plants out of business. That’s something that I fought against as a senator and that I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure that we don’t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else. You know, because it sounds like you’re in the business or you’re aware of people in the business—you know that we are now for the first time ever energy-independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down. And that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas, which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that’s an important transition. We’ve got to remain energy-independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worry about that. So I have a comprehensive energy policy, but it really does include fighting climate change, because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving toward more clean, renewable energy as quickly as we can, because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure that we don’t leave people behind. That’s why I’m the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country, because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out. A lot of them lost their lives. They were injured, but they turned the lights on and they powered our factories. I don’t want to walk away from them. So we’ve got to do something for them.',\n",
